 In the United States, pandas live in zoos. Some baby pandas are born in the zoo. At first, a baby panda does not look like its mother. It does not have much hair at all. Its eyes are closed. The baby drinks its motherâ€™s milk. The mother holds the baby in her paws. The baby grows quickly. Now it looks like its mother. Soon the little panda starts to eat bamboo. Bamboo is a kind of plant. Then the panda spends less time with its mother. It likes to be on its own. It will climb trees. It will sit on their branches.
