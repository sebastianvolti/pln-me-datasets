That keeps the dirt wet and healthy. Earthworms eat dirt and leaves as they make tunnels. They leave their droppings in the dirt. Those droppings help the dirt stay healthy. Plants grow well in healthy dirt. Some people buy earthworms to put in their gardens. Those people want to keep the dirt healthy!
