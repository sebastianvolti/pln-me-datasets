Â London's Tower Bridge In the city of London, there is a river. This river is called the Thames. In the late 1800s, people decided there needed to be a way to cross the river. So they had a contest for bridge ideas. More than 50 different bridge designs were entered in the contest. The Tower Bridge won! The Tower Bridge is made of steel and stone. It was designed to go along with the Tower of London. That is an important building nearby. It was also made to let boats pass through it. So part of the bridge opens up! This lets boats go by on the river.
