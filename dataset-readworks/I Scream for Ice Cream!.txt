Â This is a picture of Nancy Johnson. Imagine eating cold ice cream on a hot summer day. What a nice treat! Many years ago, there were no modern freezers. So it used to take hours and hours to make ice cream. But, Nancy Johnson changed that! Bengt Oberger (CC BY-SA 3.0)This is the kind of ice cream maker invented by Nancy Johnson. Nancy Johnson thought of a way to freeze ice cream much quicker. She put a lot of ice and salt in a wooden bucket. Then, she put a tin can inside the bucket. The can had ice cream mix inside it. The bucket had a handle. She would turn the handle to move the ice cream around. After only 30 minutes, the ice cream would freeze! Now, freezers make it easy to make and store ice cream!
