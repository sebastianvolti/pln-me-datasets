   Our world is made up of land and water. The seven large lands are called continents. The United States is part of the continent of North America. The continents from largest to smallest are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. This silly sentence may help you remember the names of the continents: All Ants Need Sugar And Eat Apples. The first letter of each word matches the first letter of the name of a continent. Test yourself. See if you can remember the seven continents!
