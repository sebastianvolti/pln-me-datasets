   Thousands of years ago, there were kings and queens in Egypt. They ruled over all of Egypt. These rulers were called pharaohs. Pharaohs had a lot of power. They were the leaders of a big kingdom. And the people in their land thought of them as gods. One pharaoh was named Hatshepsut. She was the first woman to have full power as a pharaoh. While she was pharaoh, people brought lots of riches to Egypt from far away. Another pharaoh was Tutankhamen. He is known today as King Tut. He became pharaoh when he was just nine! He is well known for his tomb. A tomb is the place where a pharaoh was put after he or she died. King Tut’s tomb was filled with treasures!
