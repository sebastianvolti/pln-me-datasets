   Have you ever sung “God Bless America”? It is a song about love for the United States. These are the words to the song: God bless America Land that I love Stand beside her, and guide her Through the night with a light from above From the mountains, to the prairies, To the oceans, white with foam God bless America, my home sweet home. This song is sung at many baseball games and school meetings. Some people call it one of our national anthems. A national anthem is a song that is a symbol of a country. The man who wrote “God Bless America” came to the United States as a child. He was proud that this country had become his “home sweet home.”
