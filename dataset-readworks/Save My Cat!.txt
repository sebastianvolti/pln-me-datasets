   Brad’s cat Mittens was stuck in a tree. “How will we get him down?”  asked Brad. “You can climb up the trunk,” said Lakeisha. “There are no low branches,” said Brad. “How will I hold on?”  “You can use a rope,” said Angelo. “How will I tie it?”  asked Brad. Then Brad’s dad came with a ladder. “A ladder makes climbing easier and safe,” said Brad’s dad. “I will go up carefully and save your cat.”  A few minutes later, one happy cat was safe on the ground.
