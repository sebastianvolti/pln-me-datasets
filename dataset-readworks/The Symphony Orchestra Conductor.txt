   A symphony orchestra is a large group of musicians. They play different instruments together. They play string, woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments. They make music together. How can all the musicians play together? A person leads them. This person is called the conductor. The conductor stands in front of the symphony orchestra. The conductor moves in different ways. The way the conductor moves tells the musicians how to play. The conductor tells the musicians how fast the music should be. To do this, the conductor may use a stick called a baton. Some conductors just use their hands.  The conductor also tells the musicians how loud the music should be. Sometimes the conductor tells one group of musicians to play louder than another group.
