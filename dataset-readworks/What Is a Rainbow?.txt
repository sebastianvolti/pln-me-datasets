   Rainbows sometimes show up on rainy days. Have you ever seen one? Rainbows appear in the sky only if the sun is shining. Sunlight looks white. Actually, it is made of many colors. Rainbows show off those colors. Rain comes from clouds. Clouds are made of tiny drops of water. If the drops get too big, they fall as rain. Sunlight shines through the drops of rain. The drops bend the light. The colors spread out. Then you see a rainbow! A rainbow’s top rows are red, orange, yellow, and green. The bottom rows are blue, indigo, and violet.
