 Long ago, the United States was new. People traveled by foot and horse. They also traveled in boats powered by paddles or wind. Those trips took a long time. Then steam engines were invented. The steam engine used the power of boiling water. That invention made it possible for boats to go much faster. Before long, steam engines were used in railroad trains, too. These trains could go even faster than steamboats. Now people could travel long distances more quickly. Steamboats and railroads made it easier for Americans to go places!
