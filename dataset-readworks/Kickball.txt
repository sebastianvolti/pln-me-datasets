Craig (CC BY 2.0)This is a kid kicking a rubber ball in kickball. Have you played kickball? Kickball is also called soccer baseball in Canada. That is because kickball is like both baseball and soccer. The big differences between kickball and baseball are the ball and how you hit the ball. In baseball, you use a hard, small ball. You hit the ball with a bat. In kickball, you use a large rubber ball. And you kick the ball with your foot, like in soccer!  This is a person about to roll a rubber ball. How do you play kickball? First, someone rolls a rubber ball to a person on the other team. The person on the other team tries to kick the ball. If the person kicks it far, the person can run around the bases. The other team tries to catch the ball and tag the person running around the bases. If they tag the person running, that person is “out.”  Kickball is a fun team sport. Go grab a rubber ball and some friends. Then you can start playing!
