   Long ago, a song was written about the United States. The song was named “America.”  Many people called it “My Country ’Tis of Thee.”   The song begins: My country ’tis of thee Sweet land of liberty Of thee I sing; Land where my fathers died, Land of the Pilgrims’ pride, From every mountainside Let freedom ring. Two of those words may sound unfamiliar. ’Tis is an old way to say “It is.”  Thee means “you.”   The song became very popular. Some people wanted it to be the national anthem. A national anthem is a song that represents a country. Years later, “The Star-Spangled Banner” was named the U.S. national anthem. But today, people still sing “My Country ’Tis of Thee.”
