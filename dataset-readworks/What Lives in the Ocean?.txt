Â A coral reef The ocean is full of life. What are some things that live in the ocean? Lots of things live near the top of the ocean. For example, algae grows there. Algae are like tiny plants. They are food for many animals. Coral reefs often live in the water near coasts. Seaweed and water plants grow there. Many kinds of fish live there too. Other things live in the open ocean, farther from land. Some whales and dolphins live in the open ocean. They still live near the top of the water, though. Deep in the ocean, there is less life. There is less food for animals. And the only light comes from animals that glow!
