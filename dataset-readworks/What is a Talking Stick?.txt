The others had to listen until it was their turn to hold the stick. The tribes carved talking sticks from pieces of wood. They added beads, feathers, or fur. The talking stick gave each person time to share a thought. It helped members of a tribe have peaceful meetings. What do you do in your classroom when you want to talk? You raise your hand, and everyone listens. You can try this new-but-also-old idea in your classroom. Use a talking stick!
