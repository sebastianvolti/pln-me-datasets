Museo Municipal Carmen Funes in Neuquén, ArgentinaThis is what the skeleton of the Argentinosaurus would have looked like! A farmer in Argentina found a big object on his farm. He thought it was a piece of wood.  Later, a scientist came and saw the object. His name was José F. Bonaparte. José studied dinosaur fossils.  José realized this object was not a piece of wood. It was a dinosaur’s leg bone! José and other scientists dug and found more fossilized bones. They were all from the same dinosaur. Scientists named the dinosaur Argentinosaurus.  Scientists think Argentinosaurus was one of the largest land animals in the world. It probably weighed more than 10 elephants!  Scientists have found many fossils in Argentina.
