 Photo Credit: JR Conlin Perry and Paula are visiting the pumpkin farm. Mom drives as Dad sings with them in the car. Finally, they see Farmer Jack’s Pumpkin Patch. It is a huge field of pumpkins. The pumpkins grow on vines. Farmer Jack shows them a perfect pumpkin. “This is the stem,” he says. “It is attached to the vine.”  He says the outside of the pumpkin is the rind and the lines are called ribs. He cuts the pumpkin in half. Perry and Paula touch the seeds and pulp inside. It is sticky and gooey! Farmer Jack gives them roasted pumpkin seeds. They are crunchy!
