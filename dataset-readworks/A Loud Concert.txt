 Photo Credit: B.E. Merrill Sam is going to a concert today. He is excited. His brother plays the guitar. Sam’s family arrives at the school. The music starts. Sam’s brother holds his guitar. He plucks the strings. They vibrate and make sound. Sam’s eardrums start to vibrate too. Then Sam hears the piano. The music gets louder. A girl plays the drums. The sound waves hit Sam’s ears. It’s too loud. Sam’s ears start to hurt. His mom gives him a pair of earplugs. Sam puts them in his ears. Ah! Now the sound is not too loud.
