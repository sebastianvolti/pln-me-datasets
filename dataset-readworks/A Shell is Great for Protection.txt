   All turtles have shells. Most turtles have hard shells. Hard shells protect turtles. A predator cannot bite the hard shell. Some turtles can pull their legs inside their shells. They can pull in their heads and tails too. Shells come in many different shapes. Some shells are tall and round. Other shells are flat. Sometimes cartoons show turtles leaving their shells. But… that cannot really happen! A turtle cannot leave its shell. The shell is attached to the turtle. It is a permanent part of its body.
