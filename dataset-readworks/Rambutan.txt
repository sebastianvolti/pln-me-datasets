   Different fruits come from different places in the world. People in the United States grow lots of fruits. They grow apples, oranges, and more. People in the southeast part of Asia grow different fruits. That is because some fruits grow better in the warm, wet weather there. One of those fruits is the rambutan. Have you ever heard of a rambutan? A rambutan is a small fruit. It can be red, orange, yellow, or green. And it is covered in bristles. These look like little hairs! On the inside, the fruit is white. It is a little see-through, like a grape. It tastes light and sweet. It is a very popular fruit in Asia!
