They did not like Jackie because of the color of his skin. They treated him unfairly. Some Americans thought it was okay to treat a person unfairly if you didn’t like the way he or she looked. That made Jackie angry. He decided to show he was as good as anyone else. He worked hard to become a good baseball player. He became a great baseball player. He played for a major-league team. He was the first African American to do that. Jackie worked hard to become a great player. But more importantly, he worked hard for fairness. He didn't back down when people treated him unfairly. Instead, he showed them how great he was. Because of this, he is still a hero to many people today.
