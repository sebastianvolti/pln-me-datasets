   Imagine you are in a city. You want to go to a park. How can you get there? One way you could get there is to call a taxi. A taxi is a car that will pick you up and take you where you want to go. In some cities, you might call a different kind of taxi. You might call an auto rickshaw! An auto rickshaw has three wheels. It has no doors. Instead, its sides are open. And it is much smaller than a normal car. Many places have auto rickshaws. Different places have different names for an auto rickshaw. It is called an “auto rickshaw” or “auto” in India. But in Thailand, it is called a “tuk-tuk.”  And in some places, it is called a “Bajaj.”
