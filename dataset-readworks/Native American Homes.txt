 tepee  wigwam  longhouse Long ago, Native American tribes lived in hand-made homes. Each type of home was built for the way the tribe lived. Tribe members made tepees by covering wooden poles with animal skins. Tepees were easy to build. Tribes that often moved from place to place used tepees. Wigwams were covered with bark. Tribe members tied the bark to poles with rope. Wigwams took a full day to build. They were good for tribes that moved every few months. Longhouses were built with poles and bark, too. Longhouses were very large. Sixty people could live in one! Longhouses took a lot of work to build. Tribes that lived in one place for long periods of time built longhouses.
