 This photo shows windshield wipers wiping rain off a car’s front window. Mary Anderson invented the windshield wiper. Windshield wipers help drivers stay safe on the road. They are the blades that wipe rain and snow off the front window of a car. They do that so the driver can see clearly. How did Mary Anderson think of the windshield wiper? Many years ago, she was in New York City. She was in a car, and it was snowing. Every now and then, the driver had to get out of the car. He had to wipe off the snow so that he could see. Mary thought that was silly. Then, she thought of a windshield wiper! She did not get any credit for her invention until much later. But now we know who thought of this helpful invention. Thank you, Mary Anderson!
