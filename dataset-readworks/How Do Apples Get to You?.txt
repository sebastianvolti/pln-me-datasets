   Apple farmers grow apple trees in orchards. Sometimes the apple trees stand in rows. In the fall, the trees have apples on them. That is when the apples are picked. Sometimes workers pick the apples. Sometimes big machines pick the apples. Next, the apples go into bins. The bins are put into cool warehouses. Then workers pack clean apples into boxes. Big trucks take the boxes of apples to grocery stores. People shop in those stores. They buy apples to eat. The apples can be red, green, or yellow. Why not have an apple? Crunch!
