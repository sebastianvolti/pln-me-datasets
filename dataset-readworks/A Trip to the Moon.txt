   In 1969, the United States sent a spaceship to the moon. The spaceship was called Apollo 11.  Three American astronauts were inside the spaceship. The Apollo 11 spaceship had three parts. One of the parts was called the Eagle. When the spaceship got close to the moon, two astronauts moved into the Eagle.  The Eagle flew away from the Apollo 11 spaceship’s two other parts and landed on the moon. The astronauts walked onto the moon’s surface. They wore special suits to help them breathe. They saw the sun’s light shine. They saw dark shadows. They saw rocks and mountains. The astronauts took some moon rocks with them. They flew back to the other two parts of the Apollo 11. Then all three astronauts returned to Earth.
