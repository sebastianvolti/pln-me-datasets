   If you hear thunder, go to a safe place. Thunder means that lightning is nearby. Lightning is dangerous. It can hurt people. What is a safe place? Go inside a building, a house, or a car. If you are indoors, stay away from windows. Do not take a bath or a shower. Do not use a corded telephone. What if you cannot get indoors? Do not go near water or metal. Crouch down low under a group of trees. Never stand near the tallest tree. Lightning usually strikes the tallest things on the ground.
