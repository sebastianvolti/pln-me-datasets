 Do you ever look at clouds in the sky? Clouds are made from dust, bits of ice, and drops of water that stick together. Clouds can look different from one another. Different clouds often mean different weather. Skinny clouds in a sunny sky are signs of nice weather. Piles of puffy white clouds in a blue sky mean nice weather, too. Puffy gray clouds may mean that thunder and lightning are coming. Clouds that look like a big gray blanket mean that rain or snow is on the way.
