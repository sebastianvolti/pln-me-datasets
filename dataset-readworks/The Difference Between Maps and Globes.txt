      Where are you? Maps and globes can help you answer that question. But maps and globes are different. Maps are flat. Globes are round. A map is a flat picture of a place. A map is easy to carry. You can fold a map and put it in your pocket. A globe is a big round ball that shows you the world. You can spin a globe around. Maps let you see all the places in the world at the same time. Globes give you a better picture of what our round planet looks like from space. Maps and globes help you see the world in different ways!
