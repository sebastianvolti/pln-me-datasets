   Ouch! Mosquito bites can hurt! Did you know that some animals eat mosquitoes? Little brown bats eat them! One little brown bat can eat more than 100 mosquitoes in just one hour. Little brown bats live all around the United States. They live in parks and forests. Little brown bats are nocturnal. That means "awake at night." During the day, little brown bats sleep in caves and trees. They hang by their feet to sleep! At night they fly around. They catch and eat mosquitoes and other bugs. Thank you for catching mosquitoes, little brown bats!
