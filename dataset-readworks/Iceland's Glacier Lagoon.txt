Manjula RamanThis is a glacier lagoon in Iceland.  Iceland has many glaciers. Glaciers are large areas of thick ice that move very slowly across land. These can be found in different parts of Iceland. The biggest glacier in Iceland has parts that go near the sea. Near one of these parts is a glacier lagoon. A lagoon is a shallow body of water that may open into a bigger body of water. The glacier lagoon in Iceland starts at the tip of the glacier. It opens into the sea. It is called Jökulsarlon. It used to be covered in ice from the glacier. Then, the glacier started to move back. It left the lagoon behind. The lagoon is a blue-green color. It is filled with large chunks of ice from the glacier. It is beautiful!
