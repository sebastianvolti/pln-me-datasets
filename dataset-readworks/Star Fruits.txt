   A star fruit is a sweet, yellow fruit. It grows in places with hot, wet weather. At first, this fruit only grew in places in Southeast Asia. But now, it is grown in other hot, wet places too. It is grown around the world! Star fruits are small. They have five big “ribs” on the outside. These look like big folds in the fruit’s skin. When you cut this fruit the right way, you can make a special shape. The special shape has five big points. Can you guess what shape the star fruit makes?
