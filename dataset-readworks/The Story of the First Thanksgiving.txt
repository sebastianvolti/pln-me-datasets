Note: “[Many] historians believe that most of the story of ‘The First Thanksgiving’ is a myth that people started telling more than 200 years after the event is said to have occurred.”  – Plimoth.org Library of CongressThe Pilgrims landing on Plymouth Rock, December 1620. In 1620, the Mayflower landed at the place that is now Massachusetts. There were 101 Pilgrims aboard the ship. After some time, the Pilgrims built a town called Plymouth. Living on the Land The Pilgrims landed near the area where the Wampanoag (wahm-pah-NOH-ahg) people already lived. The Wampanoag people knew how to stay safe during cold winters. They made homes called wetus (weh-TOOZ) to protect themselves from the cold. They also made warm clothing from deerskin. Help from a Friend The Pilgrims arrived close to wintertime. That winter was very cold, and many Pilgrims died. When spring came, the Pilgrims did not know where to get food. A Wampanoag man named Squanto helped the Pilgrims. He showed them where to hunt, and he taught them how to grow corn. This helped the Pilgrims get food to eat. Celebrate Together When the fall harvest came, the Pilgrims had plenty of food to eat! They were very thankful for Squanto's help. Together, the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people had a harvest celebration. For three days people ate, played games, and told stories to celebrate and give thanks.  Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division [reproduction number LC-USZC4-4961]The first Thanksgiving
