   A female sea turtle crawls along the beach. She finds a safe spot. She digs a hole and lays eggs inside it. This sea turtle mother covers the eggs with sand. She does it to protect the eggs. Otherwise, raccoons and other predators may eat the eggs. Afterward, the sea turtle mother returns to the sea. Two months later, the eggs hatch. Baby turtles dig out of the sand. They cross the beach to the ocean. In the ocean, the little turtles eat and grow. They may live for more than eighty years. Male sea turtles never return to land. Female sea turtles come back only to lay eggs. Then the cycle of life begins again.
