   Many people own cell phones. Sometimes, people use their phones to call another person. Other times, people use their phones to send text messages. Text messages are made up of typed words. The messages are sent from one cell phone to another. Text messages are often short. Some people send text messages saying, “I am leaving now.”  People who receive that kind of text may reply, “Okay. See you soon.”  The first text message was sent on December 3, 1992. The message said, “Merry Christmas.”
