The waterfall spreads across two countries, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The strong flow of the Zambezi River creates the waterfall. The water rushes down over the edge of rocky cliffs. The waterfall sprays water all around. That forms large clouds of mist. The force of the water makes a loud roaring sound.Long ago, native people saw the clouds of mist floating above the waterfall.  They heard the loud sound of the water. They named the waterfall Mosi-oa-Tunya. That means “The Smoke That Thunders.” Some people today use this name for the waterfall.Today, lots of people travel to see this waterfall. It is truly great!
