   Rain is falling. Suddenly, you see a flash. Zap! Lightning hits a tree. Next you hear a loud sound. What is happening? Lightning is electricity. It forms in clouds during a storm. Lightning can go from cloud to cloud. It can also strike the ground. When that happens, lightning takes the shortest path. It hits tall objects. It may hit buildings or trees. It may also hit people. Lightning is really hot. When it travels, it heats up the air. The very hot air makes a loud noise. That is the thunder you hear. People see lightning before they hear thunder. Why? Light travels more quickly than sound.
