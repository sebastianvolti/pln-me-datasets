   Camels are animals with long necks and long legs. Camels have humps on their backs. Some camels have one hump. Other camels have two humps. The hump is filled with fat. A newborn camel is called a calf. The calf does not have a hump on its back. The hump will grow when the calf starts eating solid food. A calf might be born with a white coat. The coat will turn brown as it grows. Sometimes a calf has trouble standing up. Its legs may be a little wobbly. Calves stay with their mothers until they are five years old.
