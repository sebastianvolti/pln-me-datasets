   It may seem like there are a lot of rules, but rules are important. There are rules everywhere. There are rules at home. There are rules at school. There are rules at the park. Why do we need rules? Rules keep us safe. Without rules, children could run in the halls. That would not be safe. Someone might get hurt. Rules keep things fair. Without rules, a friend might not get a turn in a game. That would not be fair. Without rules, the world would not be safe or fair.
