   People live in homes. They shop in malls. They work in offices. Who designs these places? Architects do! Architects come up with ideas to build things. They talk to the person who hires them. They find out what needs to be built. Architects think of a good design. They make sure the building is safe. They want it to look nice too. Architects draw sketches. They also build models. That helps architects share their ideas. Now other people can see what the building will look like.
