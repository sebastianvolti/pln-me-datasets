Or it may have huge cracks in it. And the ice does not melt away when spring comes. The land stays covered in ice for many, many years. What youâ€™re thinking of is a glacier! A glacier is a large area of thick ice that stays frozen over the years. The ice moves very slowly over the land. You could see a glacier in many different countries. Iceland is one country that has many glaciers. Many people go to see the glaciers in Iceland. Some of them even go hiking on the ice!
