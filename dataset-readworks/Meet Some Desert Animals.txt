   Deserts are very dry places. They get almost no rain. Interesting animals live in Earth’s deserts. Here are a few of them. Jackrabbits have long ears. Their ears help them get rid of body heat and stay cool in the desert. Jackrabbits eat twigs and cactus plants. The desert tortoise digs holes, called burrows, under the ground. Staying in its burrows helps the tortoise keep cool when the desert sun is very hot. Prairie dogs are fast runners. They run quickly from desert enemies such as coyotes and eagles. Prairie dogs call to one another when danger is near.
