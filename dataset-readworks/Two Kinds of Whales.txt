     A whale is a huge sea animal. Different kinds of whales live in our oceans. Whales have blowholes on their heads. Some have one blowhole and some have two. A whale lifts its head up from the water to breathe through its blowhole. The killer whale has one blowhole. It has sharp teeth. It uses its teeth to hunt for seals. It is as big as one school bus. The blue whale has two blowholes. It doesn’t have teeth, but it eats a lot of krill. Krill are very small and look like shrimp. The blue whale is the biggest whale. In fact, it is the largest animal in the world. It is as big as three school buses!
