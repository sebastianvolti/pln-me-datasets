   If you jump up, what happens? You come back down. What makes that happen? It is a force called gravity. Gravity pulls objects toward each other. Earth has gravity. The moon, the sun, and the other planets have gravity, too. Big objects have stronger gravity than smaller ones. For example, the moon does not have as much gravity as Earth. If you walked on the moon, you would bounce high. But you would still come back down. Gravity keeps you on Earth, but it also adds fun to life. What pulls your sled down a hill or helps you bounce on a trampoline? Gravity!
