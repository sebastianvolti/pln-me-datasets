   A long time ago Britain had 13 colonies in North America. A colony is a place ruled by a country far away. Britain sent things to the colonies. One popular thing was tea. In 1773, Britain made some strict rules about buying tea. Then the people in the colonies became very mad. One of Britain’s 13 colonies was Massachusetts. The people there did not want the tea from Britain. On December 16, 1773, some of these people put on costumes. Then they went onto some boats in Boston Harbor. The boats had tea from Britain. They threw 342 chests of tea into the water. Britain was very mad when it found out! This event is now called the Boston Tea Party.
