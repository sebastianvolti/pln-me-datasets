   Marco and Maria are camping in the yard. They have their flashlights and some snacks. Marco swings his flashlight around in the tent. Hoot! Hoot! He makes scary noises. Maria is not scared. She remembers what she learned in school about shadows. A solid object in front of light makes a shadow. She shines her flashlight on the side of the tent. She puts her hand in front of the light. She twists her hand around. “Look, a snake!”  Maria says. Marco jumps. Then he sees that it is only a shadow. They laugh and laugh together.
