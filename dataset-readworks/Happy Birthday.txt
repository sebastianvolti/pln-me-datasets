Some people have birthday cakes and candles too. Some celebrate their birthdays in other ways. In China, children and their families eat noodles for a long life. In India, a child gives chocolates to everyone. In Mexico, a child breaks open a piñata. Everyone shares the candies inside. In Russia, a child might have a birthday pie with a birthday wish cut into the crust. Birthdays are fun around the world!
