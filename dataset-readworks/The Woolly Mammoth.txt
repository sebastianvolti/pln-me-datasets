   The woolly mammoth is an animal that lived very long ago. It died off thousands of years ago. You won’t find any live ones on Earth today. The woolly mammoth was as big as an elephant. It had two very large teeth called tusks. The tusks stuck out of its mouth. It had thick brown hair. It had ears that are smaller than elephant ears. Woolly mammoths lived in a very cold part of the world. This place is called the Arctic. They lived during the Ice Age. The Earth was very, very cold during this time. Woolly mammoths ate a lot of grass. They also ate other plants and flowers. They did not eat animals.
