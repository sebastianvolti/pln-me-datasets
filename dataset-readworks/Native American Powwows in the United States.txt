Native Americans often do special dances at powwows. Some dances are like those from long ago. Some dances even tell stories from long ago. Sometimes the dancers wear the traditional clothes of their group. At many powwows, people cook and eat Native American foods. A powwow in the southwestern U.S. might have fry bread. At many powwows, people can buy Native American arts and crafts. A powwow in the northeastern U.S. might have grass baskets. Powwows are special times when many Native Americans get together and share their cultures.
