   Trees are plants. Plants are living things that need sun and water to grow. Trees have many parts. The trunk is like the stem of the tree. Inside the trunk are tubes. The tubes carry water and food to all parts of the tree. The leaves and branches are the crown of the tree. The crown gives shade to the rest of the tree. The bark of a tree covers its outside. Bark keeps the inside of the tree safe. The roots grow into the ground. They carry water and other food from the ground to the rest of the tree.
