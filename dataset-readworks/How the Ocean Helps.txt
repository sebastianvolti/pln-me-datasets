   Many people love the ocean. They like to go there to see the beach. They like swimming in the water. Some people like sailing or fishing in the ocean. But the ocean isn’t just a fun place to visit. It’s also important to our earth! How does the ocean help our earth? It stops the earth from getting too cold. Here’s how it does that. First, the sun shines on the ocean. The ocean’s water can take in the heat from the sun. Then, that water flows around the world. It moves that warmth around the world. Because this warmth gets spread around, more parts of Earth can have living things. That’s a big help!
