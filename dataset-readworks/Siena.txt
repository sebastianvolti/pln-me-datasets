In the center of this city, there is a large piazza. That is a large space where people in a town can gather. This piazza in Siena is called the Piazza del Campo. It is shaped like a shell. Two times a year, something very special happens in the Piazza del Campo. There are horse races! This event is called the Palio. Tons of people go to watch the horse races. The horses race three times around the Piazza del Campo. The whole race takes about a minute. But the fun goes on much longer than that!
