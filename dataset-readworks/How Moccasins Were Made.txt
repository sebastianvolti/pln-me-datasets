   Since long ago, Native Americans have been wearing shoes made of soft leather. These shoes are known as moccasins (MAH-kuh-suhns). A lot of moccasins are made from the skin of a deer or a moose. But moccasins long ago were made differently than moccasins today. Long ago, members of the tribe dried the animal skin, turning it into leather. Then the members shaped the leather to cover their feet. Each tribe had its own decorations for moccasins. Some tribes used beads. In other tribes, members painted symbols onto the animal skins. Some moccasins had hard bottoms. They were good for walking on sharp stones or prickly cacti. Moccasins with soft bottoms were best for walking in leaves.
