Kevin Krejci (CC BY 2.0)  The ocean is full of garbage. Most garbage comes from land. How does garbage get into the ocean? Wind blows litter there. Rivers also carry trash to the ocean. The garbage collects in gyres. A gyre is a place where water moves in a circle. The garbage cannot escape the gyre. It builds up. When that happens, it is called a “garbage patch.”  Fish and birds eat the garbage. Eating the garbage makes them sick. Ocean garbage is bad for animals and Earth.
