   Henry has a problem. He keeps forgetting his red homework folder. Sometimes he leaves it in the classroom. Sometimes he leaves it at home. His teacher Mr. Lopez is not happy. Henry has forgotten the red folder three times this week. Henry looks at his big blue binder and gets an idea. He asks his father for the hole puncher. His father helps him punch three holes in the side of the red folder. Henry puts the red folder in his blue binder. He always has his blue binder with him. Now he will always have his red homework folder too.
