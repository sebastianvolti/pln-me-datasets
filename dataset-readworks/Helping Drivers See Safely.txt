He had to stop the streetcar and go outside to clean the window. When he came back, he was all wet. Anderson thought of a way to clean the window from inside the car. She made a handle with a rubber blade at the end. The driver could move the handle from inside a car. The handle pushed the blade across the window. She called her invention the windshield wiper. Now people stay safe and dry when driving in the rain!
