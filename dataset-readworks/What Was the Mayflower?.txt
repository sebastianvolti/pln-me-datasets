   Long ago, a ship sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from England. The ship was called the Mayflower. It carried about a hundred people. These men, women, and children were looking for a place where they could worship as they wanted. The people were known as the Pilgrims. The trip took more than two months. The inside of the Mayflower was dark and wet. There were no windows. The ceiling was very low. Some people got sick. The Mayflower finally reached land. Pilgrim families stayed on the ship. Pilgrim men built houses. They planted crops for food to eat. Soon, the Pilgrims had new homes in North America.
