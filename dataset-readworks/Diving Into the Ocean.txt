  The ocean is huge. Parts of it are very deep. Imagine diving into the ocean and going down to the deepest parts. You’d see and feel things changing as you went down!Near the top, you’d be able to see. Light can get through the water near the top of the ocean. So can heat. You’d see many animals in this part of the ocean.Then, you’d go down further. There would be less light. It would get colder as you went down. The animals here would be different.Then, you’d go even further down. There would be almost no light at all. But some of the animals would give off light! You’d also feel more pressure from all the water above you. And it would be very cold.Further down, you wouldn’t be able to see a thing. There would be almost no animals. The water would be freezing. You would be crushed under the water!
