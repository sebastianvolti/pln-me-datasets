   Fruits grow in different ways. Apples grow on trees. Grapes grow on vines. Blueberries grow on bushes. All fruits have something special. Do you know what that is? Seeds! Some fruits have one seed. Others have many seeds. A peach has one seed. A coconut has one seed too. A pumpkin has many small seeds. A strawberry has many tiny seeds. They are on the outside of the fruit. Seeds are important because they can grow into new plants. What happens when seeds fall to the ground? Plants grow. Those plants will have stems, leaves, flowers, fruits—and more seeds.
