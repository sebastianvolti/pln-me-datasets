   In the United States, people celebrate Independence Day on July 4. Mexico has an Independence Day, too! Mexico celebrates its independence on September 16. Mexico was ruled by Spain for around three hundred years. Then, on September 16, 1810, a priest in Mexico spoke up. He called for people to go against the Spanish. He wanted them to fight for freedom! Mexico didn’t become free from Spain for years. But Mexicans celebrate the day the priest called for freedom. Big bands play in the streets. People set off fireworks. And people eat great food!
