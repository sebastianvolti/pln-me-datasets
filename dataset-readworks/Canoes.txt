     Long ago, Native Americans invented a new way to travel. They called their invention a canoe (kuh-NOO). Canoes are long boats that people sit in and move with paddles. Native Americans needed to go across water to hunt and find food. They needed something that could take them where they could fish. The canoe helped them do those things. The Native Americans made canoes by carving out the trunks of trees. They made paddles from long branches. We still use canoes today like the ones Native Americans invented long ago!
