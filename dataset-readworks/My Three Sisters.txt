   My name is Tasha. I have three sisters. We look a lot alike. We all have brown eyes and brown hair. I am the youngest. But I am very tall. I am taller than one of my older sisters. I asked my mom why. She said that it’s because Dad is tall. His parents were both tall too. Mom is shorter. She says I am tall like Dad. Mom says that we have her color eyes. They are the same shade of brown. Dad has blue eyes. I am still growing. I wonder how tall I am going to be.
