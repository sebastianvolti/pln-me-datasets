   In 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin flew in a rocket ship. They landed on the moon. Armstrong and Aldrin became the first people ever to walk there. The two men left footprints on the moon. Their footprints are still there! There is no wind to blow the footprints away. The men left an American flag on the moon, too. They took moon rocks with them. Scientists on Earth have studied the rocks. Neil Armstrong took the first step on the moon. As he did, he said, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”  His sentence became famous.
