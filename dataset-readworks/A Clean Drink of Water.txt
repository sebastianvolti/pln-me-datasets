 All people need clean water. They need it for drinking, for cooking, and for bathing. Some people in a village in South America did not have clean water. Their water was full of oil and dirt. People there got sick when they drank the water. Far away, other people heard about the problem. They sent empty water tanks to the village. Rainwater fell into the tanks. That water was clean. Now the people in that village have clean water.
