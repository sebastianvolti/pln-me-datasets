Â This is a snowboarder in the middle of a jump. Do you love skateboarding or skiing? If you love both, you can try snowboarding! You can only snowboard when there is snow on the ground. You also need to be on a snowy hill or mountain. When people snowboard, they wear boots. These boots are special because they attach to the snowboard. First, you attach one boot to the board. Then, you start sliding down a snowy hill on the board. You put your other boot on the snowboard. You can turn the snowboard to slow down and stop. It takes a lot of balance!
