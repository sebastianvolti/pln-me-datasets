   All animals have ways to protect themselves. Turtles have hard shells that keep them safe. Many turtles can pull their bodies inside their shells. That makes it harder for other animals to hurt them. Walking sticks are insects. They look like sticks. That makes them hard to see. A predator may never notice the insect. Puffer fish can swallow a lot of water. The extra water makes them look very big. Puffer fish also have spines that can hurt predators. Animals protect themselves in many ways.
