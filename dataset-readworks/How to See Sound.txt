   Sounds are all around. Sounds are inside and outside. Sounds can be loud or soft. Sound can make things vibrate, or move. You can hear sounds, but can you see them? Yes! Try this to see how sounds can make things move. First, tape a piece of thread onto the speaker of a radio. Let the thread hang down in front of the speaker. Next, turn on the radio. Watch the thread carefully. Does the sound make the thread move? If not, turn up the volume to make the sound louder. The sound from the speaker should make the thread move.
