   KK Gregory liked to play in the snow. But KK didn’t like when snow went up her sleeve. It made her feel wet and too cold to play. Even though she was only ten years old, KK decided to do something about this problem. She made coverings that fit over her upper hands and wrists. Her wrists stayed dry! She called her idea Wristies. She made them in different sizes and colors. Soon, she was selling Wristies to other people. Today, KK’s invention is helping a lot of people stay dry in the snow.
