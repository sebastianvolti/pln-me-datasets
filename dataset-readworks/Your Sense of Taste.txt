   Taste is one of your five senses. It’s an important way you learn about the world. And it also keeps you from eating or drinking things that have gone bad! How do you taste something? With your tongue! The top of your tongue has lots of small bumps. Those bumps hold your taste buds. Taste buds tell you what kind of flavor something has. They can sense sweet, sour, bitter, and salty flavors. They can also sense umami, or meaty flavors. Your sense of smell and your sense of taste go together. Smelling things helps you taste their flavor! Next time you have a stuffy nose, think about what you’re eating. Does the flavor of the food seem a little weak?
