   Water is always moving. It moves between the earth and the sky. This movement is called the water cycle. Here is how it happens. The sun shines on a pond. The water heats up. Some water turns into gas. That change is called evaporation. The gas is called vapor. The vapor rises. High in the sky, the air is cold. The vapor becomes a cloud. That change is called condensation. In the clouds, drops of water form. The drops fall to earth. Falling drops are called precipitation. Water falls as rain, sleet, or snow. Rain falls into the pond. That change is called collection. What happens next? The water cycle starts over!
