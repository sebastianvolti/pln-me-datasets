   Callie was putting her books away. She could not close her new backpack. “This is your assignment,” Ms. Jenkins said. She talked about the homework that was due the next day. Callie did not stop to listen. She kept trying to close her backpack. “Now, does anyone have any questions?”  Ms. Jenkins asked. Callie raised her hand. “Do we have an assignment?”  she asked. “I already told the class, Callie,” said Ms. Jenkins. “See me after class, and I will explain it to you.”  Callie walked next to Ms. Jenkins as they left the classroom. “Next time, I will be a good listener,” Callie said.
