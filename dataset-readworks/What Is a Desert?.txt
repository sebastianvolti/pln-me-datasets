   A desert is a dry place. Very little rain falls in the desert. Many deserts are hot. Deserts can be sandy or rocky. Deserts are dry, but plants and animals find ways to live there. Cactus plants grow in deserts. Cacti can live with very little water. Camels live in deserts. Camels store fat in their humps. They live off the fat when they cannot eat or drink. Camels, too, have found ways to live in the dry desert.
