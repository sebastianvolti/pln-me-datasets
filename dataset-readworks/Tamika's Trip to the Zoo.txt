   Tamika and her father planned a trip to the zoo. The new baby polar bears were there. They were called Milly and Tilly. Tamika would meet her friend Jesse near the polar bears. Tamika’s father drew a map of the path they would follow. He drew a picture of the zoo’s front gate. That is where they had to show their tickets. He drew a path from the gate to the polar bears. The path turned left. Then it went straight. The polar bears would be right there. He drew a picture of a baby polar bear on the map. When they got to the bear house, Jesse was there!
