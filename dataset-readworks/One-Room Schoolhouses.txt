   Long ago, many children went to school in one-room schoolhouses. Younger and older children were in the same class. The children sat at desks. They learned to read and write. They learned math too. Children usually did not write on paper. They wrote on slates. Slates are like small chalkboards. The schoolhouse had a stove. The stove kept the schoolhouse warm in winter. Children had to bring wood to put in the stove. There were no school cafeterias then. Children went home for lunch, or they brought lunch with them. Schools long ago were very different from schools today.
