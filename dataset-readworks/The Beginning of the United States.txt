   Before the United States was a country, there were thirteen colonies. A colony is a place that is ruled by another country far away. These colonies were ruled by Britain. The first colony was Virginia. People in this colony came from Britain. After Virginia, more and more people came. They made more colonies. In the beginning, the thirteen colonies were mostly happy to be a part of Britain. Britain gave them many things like sugar, paper, and tea. By 1775, Britain tried to make the colonies pay more money for those things. The colonies became very unhappy. They also didn’t like some laws Britain made. So they decided to split from Britain and become a new country. This new country was the United States.
