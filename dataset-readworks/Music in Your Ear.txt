   Guitars make music. Here’s how the music gets from the guitar to you. A person plucks a guitar string. That plucking makes the string vibrate. (Something that vibrates moves back and forth very fast. ) Vibrations can make sound waves. The sound waves move through the air. They go into your ear. Inside your ear is something shaped like a tiny drum. It is called your eardrum. The eardrum helps you to hear. The waves from the guitar make your eardrum vibrate. When your eardrum vibrates, you hear the sound of the guitar.
