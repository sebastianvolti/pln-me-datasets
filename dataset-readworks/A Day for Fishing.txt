   “Why do I have to wake up so early?”  Rosie asked. She rubbed her eyes and looked out the window. It was still dark. Her dad was making pancakes. Rosie put on her jeans and a shirt. Then she ate her pancakes and was ready to go. Rosie’s dad drove to the river. They saw the sun come up in the sky. “Look at the sunrise,” Rosie said. She and her dad caught two fish. They ate lunch. Then they drove back home. Later that day, Rosie said to her dad, “Look at the sunset!”  They saw the bright red sky. Rosie loved her day of fishing.
