 Mummy in a museum In ancient Egypt, people believed that a dead person’s spirit lived on. Pharaohs were the rulers of Egypt. Sometimes a pharaoh would die. The spirit of a dead pharaoh was very important. So people did what they could to help it. One way they did this was by turning the pharaoh’s body into a mummy. This made sure the body stayed in good shape. That way, the spirit could go back to the body. To make a mummy, they dried the whole body out. They sometimes took out the brain. The last thing they did was wrap the body in cloth. This protected the body. The pharaoh’s mummy was put in a special case in a pyramid. The Egyptians did a lot to help their pharaoh’s spirit out!
