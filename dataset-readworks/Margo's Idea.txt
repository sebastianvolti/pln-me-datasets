Margo walked in the yard and found 25 rocks. She had to carry the rocks to the porch. She filled her pockets with rocks, but her pockets were too small. She filled her yellow pail with rocks, but the pail was too heavy. Then she saw her red wagon under the tree. She filled the wagon with rocks and pulled it to the porch. Now she and her dad could put together her birdbath!
