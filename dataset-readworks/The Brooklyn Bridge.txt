National Park ServiceBrooklyn Bridge Have you ever seen a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge? This is a famous bridge in New York City. It connects Brooklyn and Manhattan. Those are two parts of the city.  How does the Brooklyn Bridge stay up? Big stone towers and big steel ropes! Big ropes go between two towers. More steel ropes hang from those big ropes. The roadway hangs from these ropes.  The Brooklyn Bridge also has a web of steel ropes on each side. These make the bridge extra strong. Thatâ€™s good, because many people and cars go across it every day!
