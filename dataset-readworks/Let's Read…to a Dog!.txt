A reader dog is a dog that listens and helps kids with their reading at schools and libraries. Scientists have learned that dogs can help kids who struggle with reading to feel calm. Feeling calm helps kids read words correctly. That makes it easier for them to learn from what they are reading. Kids also know that dogs won't judge their reading. So, kids feel better about their reading when they read to a dog. To become a reader dog, a dog has to go through many steps with its owner. The dog has to learn to obey basic commands. For instance, the dog needs to sit, stay, and lie down when they're told. Also, the dog's owner has to pass some tests. The owner and dog need to work together as a team.
