The person can safely cross the street. The wheelchair will not fall over. Sometimes curb ramps can be dangerous, however. The ramps make the sidewalk level with the street. People who are blind may not know they are on a ramp. They might walk into a busy street. Inventors thought about making a better curb ramp. They added a bumpy plastic covering to existing curb ramps. People who are blind can feel the bumps. Those people will know they are on a ramp. Wheelchairs can safely roll down the ramp too. Now curb ramps help everyone.
