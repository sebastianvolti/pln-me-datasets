   The sun has set. I see a red-and-orange glow in the sky. Soon it gets dark outside. Now I see stars in the sky. There are so many! Stars are made of hot gases. They give off their own light. Some stars look white. Others may look blue, red, or gold. Stars are different sizes. They can be big or small. The sun is a star. It is the star closest to Earth. The other stars are farther away. That is why they look so small. In fact, some faraway stars are bigger than the sun.
