 a raccoon Do you like to have a snack at night? Raccoons do. They are nocturnal. That means they are awake at night. At night, raccoons eat plants and small animals. They also eat human food they find in the trash! There are more raccoons in cities than in the country. That’s because cities have a lot more trash, with more food to eat! Have you ever seen a raccoon? They have black fur around their eyes. The fur looks like a mask. Raccoons also have big, furry tails. Their tails have black and brown rings. If you see a raccoon, leave it alone. It may look cute, but it is a wild animal.
