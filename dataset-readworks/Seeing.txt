   Sight is one of your five senses. It helps you learn about the world around you. You see things with your eyes. When you see something, light is bouncing off that thing and into your eyes. Your eyes take in lots of information from that light. They take in information about color, shape, and movement. Then they send that information to your brain. Your brain can tell you what you’re looking at! Eyes are very important. They help you spot danger so you can stay safe. They help you spot the things around you so you can move through the world. And they help you spot your friend on the school bus, too!
