Caramel and jam are spread inside of the two wafers. Cheese is sometimes added to the oblea too. Do you think that cheese would taste good with caramel and jam? If you said yes, then you should visit Colombia! Many people in Colombia also think itâ€™s delicious. If you do not think it would taste good, that is okay. There are many different kinds of obleas. Some of them are filled with fruit. Some of them are filled with cream. What would you like in your oblea sandwich?
