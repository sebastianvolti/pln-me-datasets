   The moon is a dark place. It does not make its own light. So why do we see a bright moon in the night sky? Here is what really happens. The sun’s light shines on the moon and then bounces off the moon. The moonlight that we see is really just sunshine lighting up the moon. The moon is not the only thing that shines because of the sun. Have you seen pictures of Earth taken from space? The earth looks as if it is shining, too. But of course Earth does not make its own light, either. Our home planet is also lit by sunlight.
