Â Photo Credit: Liz West I have a dog. Her name is Misty. She loves to play ball. I throw the ball to Misty. She uses her teeth to pick it up. Then she runs to me. She drops the ball at my feet. If Misty hears a noise, she stops. She raises her ears and listens. Misty barks if she sees another dog. She barks loudly to protect me. After we play ball, we go inside. Misty runs to her bowl and drinks water. I give her some dog food to eat. Then Misty takes a nap. Being a dog can be hard work!
