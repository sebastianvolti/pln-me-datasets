   Brass instruments are made of brass. Brass is a bright, yellow metal. These instruments have long tubes. One end has a mouthpiece. The other end has a bell-shaped opening. To play a brass instrument, musicians start by making a buzzing sound with their mouths. Then the musicians put their mouths on the mouthpiece. The buzzing sound goes through the long tubes. Then the sound comes out of the bell-shaped end. Brass instruments can make very loud sounds! A group of musicians play brass instruments in a symphony orchestra. Brass instruments make the loudest sounds in a symphony orchestra.  Trumpets, horns, trombones, and tubas are brass instruments. They are played in an orchestra. In the brass group, the trumpet makes the highest sound. This is because it has the shortest tube. The tuba makes the lowest sound.
