   Chris was walking with Grandpa. “Let’s have lunch,” Grandpa said. “There is a restaurant across the street.”  “That sounds good,” said Chris. He started to cross the street. “Wait!”  cried Grandpa. “You should never walk into the street without looking! You should hold my hand, too.”  “But I did not hear any cars coming,” said Chris. “It is still dangerous to cross the street without looking both ways first.”  “I am sorry,” said Chris. Grandpa took Chris’s hand. They looked both ways. There were no cars coming. Together, they walked safely across the street.
