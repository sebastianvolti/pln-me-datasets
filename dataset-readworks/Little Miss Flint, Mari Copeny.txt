An activist is a person who works to change the world. When she was eight years old, Mari realized the water in her town was not good to drink. She lived in Flint, Michigan. The water had a lot of germs in it. All the people in Flint could only drink bottled water. If they drank the water from the tap, they would get very sick. Mari Copeny wanted to fix this problem. She wrote a letter to the president of the United States. She told him about Flint’s water problems. He got her letter and decided to come to Flint, Michigan. Many people across the country heard about his visit. They realized that Flint’s local government was not fixing the problem. Many people started donating money to help Mari’s community. Mari did not stop there! She raised thousands of dollars to help buy bottled water and water filters for people in Flint. She also raised money to give school children supplies. Over the next few years, she continued to help Flint, but she also started looking for ways to help different U.S. cities with their water problems. She wants to run for president when she grows up. She says, “When I’m president, I’ll make sure I use my voice to speak for the people — especially kids.”
