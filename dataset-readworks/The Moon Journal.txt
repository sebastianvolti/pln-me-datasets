One night, Amir saw the moon. It looked like just a sliver. Last week, the moon had looked bigger.  Amir wanted to start a journal. He would draw the moon each night. The next night, Amir did not see the moon. He colored the page in his journal black. The next night, he saw the sliver again. Amir drew the moon every night for three months. He noticed a pattern. Amir noticed that on some nights he could not see the moon. Then, the moon would appear again. It seemed to get bigger for many nights until it became a bright circle. Then it appeared to get smaller again.
