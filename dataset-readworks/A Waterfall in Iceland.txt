A waterfall is a place in a river where water spills downward suddenly. Waterfalls can be big or small. They can be little, thin streams of water. They can also be huge and powerful! Iceland is an island country in the Atlantic Ocean. It has many waterfalls. One of its waterfalls is called Seljalandsfoss. “Foss” is the word for waterfall in Iceland. The water in Seljalandsfoss falls from almost 200 feet high. It lands in a pool below. But something about the way the water falls makes this waterfall special. It’s special because people can walk behind it! There is a cave behind the waterfall. Many people visit the waterfall and take a walk behind the water.
