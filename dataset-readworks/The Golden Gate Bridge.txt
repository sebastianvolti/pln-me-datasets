 Golden Gate Bridge The Golden Gate Bridge is a bridge in San Francisco, California. It is very well known. It is known for being beautiful. And it’s known for its bright color… orange! This bridge is in an area where earthquakes can happen. Bridges and buildings can fall down during earthquakes. So the Golden Gate Bridge was built to be very strong. The bridge has towers that go into the water. Big steel ropes connect the towers. And more steel ropes go from those ropes to the roadway. So the bridge hangs over the water!
