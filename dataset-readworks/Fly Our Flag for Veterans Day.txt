   November 11 is a special day called Veterans Day. Every year on that day we think about men and women who are veterans. Veterans are people who have served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Veterans worked to help our country in many ways. Some worked on ships to keep our oceans and coasts safe. Some were doctors or nurses who cared for people who were hurt or sick. Some veterans flew planes or helicopters. People across our country have parades to honor veterans. Fly our flag and thank our veterans on Veterans Day!
