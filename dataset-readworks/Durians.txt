   Have you ever had an apple? How about a banana? Both of these fruits are easily found in the United States. Have you ever had a durian? This is a fruit that isn’t often found in the U.S. This kind of fruit grows in some warm countries in the eastern half of the world. Durians are big fruits. They are about the size of a football. They are brownish green and hard on the outside. And they are covered with spikes! On the inside, the fruit is yellow-ish white. It feels creamy. And it tastes a little sweet. But the fruit doesn’t smell sweet… it smells very, very strongly. Some people don’t mind the smell. But many people do. In fact, some places don’t allow durians in because of their strong smell!
