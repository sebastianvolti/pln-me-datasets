People traveling across the United States went by horse and wagon. It took months to travel that way. So 150 years ago, people started building a new railroad. This railroad would connect the East Coast to the West Coast. Building the railroad was hard work. People worked in bad weather. They had to blast holes in mountains to make tunnels. The railroad took six years to complete. When it was done, people could travel across the country much more easily.
