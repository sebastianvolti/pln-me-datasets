   People learn about the world through their five senses. Touch is one of those five senses. You can sense how things feel because of your skin. Your skin has three different layers. These layers have different jobs. One of those layers tells you what things feel like. It can tell you if something is soft or hard. It can tell you if something is smooth or rough. It can tell you if something is cold or hot. It can tell you a lot about how something feels! Your sense of touch helps keep you safe. Think about a hot stove. What would happen if you put your hand near it? Your sense of touch would tell you that the stove feels hot… too hot! And you’d pull your hand away. Your sense of touch would stop you from getting burned!
