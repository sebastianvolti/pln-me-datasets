   Uncle Leo and Anna go to the food store. Anna brings along two cloth bags. “What are those?”  Uncle Leo asks. “They are cloth bags. We use them instead of the plastic bags they give us at the store,” Anna says. She tells him that plastic bags can hurt animals. Sometimes sea turtles and birds find the bags and eat them. “Animals can get sick,” Anna says. “I will have to get some cloth bags too,” Uncle Leo says.
