   Kerry Kangaroo was growing up. Mama Kangaroo let him out of her pouch. “You are getting big,” said Mama. “Big kangaroo kids need to learn to hop.”  Kerry tried out his strong legs and big feet. He hopped a few times. He hopped and hopped. He hopped away from Mama. He hopped here and there. He even hopped with his eyes closed! Splash! Kerry hopped right into a water hole! Mama Kangaroo helped Kerry out. “That is too much hopping for one day!”  cried Kerry. He hopped back into his cozy pouch. He was tired. He fell fast asleep.
