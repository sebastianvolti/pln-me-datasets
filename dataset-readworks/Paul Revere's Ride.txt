   A man named Paul Revere lived a long time ago. He lived in America. He heard some important news. The news was that British soldiers planned to attack the Americans. The British could come by sailing across the sea. They could also come by going across the land. Paul wanted to tell the other Americans the news! He thought about how to tell them. Paul asked his friend to help. He told his friend to put up lanterns in a church. His friend would hang one lantern if the British came across the land. His friend would put up two lanterns if they came across the sea. Later, two lanterns were hung. Then Paul rode on a horse to warn other Americans.
