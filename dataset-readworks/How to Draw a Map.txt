You can help by drawing a map of the classroom. Use a pencil and a large piece of white paper. Draw a square or rectangle. Mark the places a new student may need to find. Draw a desk to show where your teacher sits. Show where the reading center is. Show where the science center is. Draw an X to show the door. Now your new friends will have a map of their classroom.
