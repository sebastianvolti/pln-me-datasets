 Geyser in Iceland Do you know what a geyser is? A geyser is a natural pool of hot water that sometimes erupts. When a geyser erupts, it sends a tall jet of water and steam into the air. The English word “geyser” comes from the Icelandic word “geysir.”  In fact, Iceland has a geyser that is named Geysir. This is the world’s oldest one! It does not erupt anymore. Another geyser can be found nearby, though. This one is called Strokkur. Strokkur erupts every few minutes. The hot water from Strokkur can reach as high as 40 meters. That’s really high!
