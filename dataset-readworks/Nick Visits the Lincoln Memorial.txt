   Nick’s family was visiting Washington, D.C. They had seen many of the sights. Today they were going to the Lincoln Memorial. Nick had learned about it in school. He knew it was built to honor Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States. Nick and his family walked up all the steps. He saw the big statue. The statue showed President Lincoln sitting down. Nick’s father asked, “Nick, do you know what the memorial is made from?”  “It is made from a stone called marble,” Nick answered. “I see you learned a lot about the memorial,” said his father. “Great job!”
