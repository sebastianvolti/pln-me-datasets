   The telephone was invented many years ago. Long ago, all telephones were as big as a lunchbox. They had to stay on a table or wall. Telephones had only one purpose. They were used to speak to other people. Today many people use cellular phones. Cellular phones can be smaller than your hand. They can be moved anywhere. These phones can do many things. You can use them to send text messages. You can use them to take photographs. You can use them to play games. There is something else you can use cell phones to do. You can still use them to speak to other people!
