 illustration of Sacagawea with Lewis and Clark Did you know that the United States has one-dollar coins? You can use these coins to pay for anything you’d use a one-dollar bill to pay for. Some of these coins have a picture of Sacagawea on one side. Sacagawea was a Native American woman. She traveled from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean with two explorers named Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Lewis and Clark did not speak any Native American languages. Sacagawea was an important member of the exploration team because she was able to speak with other Native Americans. She helped Lewis and Clark learn from them and trade with them. The Sacagawea dollar coins celebrate Sacagawea’s life. They remind us of how she helped the explorers.
