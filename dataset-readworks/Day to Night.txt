Photo Credit: FotoSleuth  Sunlight is shining through my window. It wakes me up. Morning is here! My mom calls out to me, “Justin! Breakfast is ready!”  I get up and get ready for school. We learn science and math. After lunch, we go outside to play. The sun is high in the sky. It feels warm. The rest of the day goes by quickly. I get on the bus to go home. The sun is lower in the sky. It feels colder outside. My family eats dinner. Now it is dark outside. The sun has set. I look out the window. I can see the moon and stars. It is time for bed.
