   The Pilgrims came to America nearly 400 years ago. They came to be free to worship and live in their own way. Pilgrim families brought their children with them. What was life like for Pilgrim children? At a young age, they had to work to help their families. Young children could carry wood for fires. Some learned to cook. Older children helped plant crops for food. Pilgrim children learned to read and write. Their parents taught them at home. But it was not all work for Pilgrim children! They had some time to play. They played games like leapfrog or marbles. Some children had dolls made of cloth. They called the dolls "poppets."
