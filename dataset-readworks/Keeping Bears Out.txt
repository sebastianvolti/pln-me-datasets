   Wild bears live in many U.S. national parks. People visit the parks. People bring food when they camp out. Hungry bears smell the food. They want to eat the food. Bears look for leftover food in trash cans. Bears look for food at people’s campsites. That is a problem for people. Park workers are trying to solve this problem. Workers have put out special garbage cans. The bears cannot break into the cans. Workers tell park visitors to use special boxes for their food. The boxes are metal. People must lock them. Bears cannot get into the boxes.
