   Toucans are noisy birds. They live in the tropical rain forest. Toucans have black feathers and large orange beaks. They use their big beaks to eat fruit. They also eat eggs and insects. Toucans live in small flocks, or groups. Baby toucans have small beaks. As the toucans grow bigger, their beaks grow bigger too. Some people like to keep toucans as pets. But the best home for a toucan is in the rain forest.
