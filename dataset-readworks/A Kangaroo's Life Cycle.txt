 A grown-up kangaroo can be bigger than a person. But these animals start out very small. A newborn kangaroo is the size of a jellybean! It has no hair. It cannot see. The tiny kangaroo crawls into its motherâ€™s pouch. In the pouch, it grows bigger. It grows fur. It opens its eyes. A baby kangaroo is called a joey. When it is big enough, the joey will leave the pouch. The joey returns to the pouch if it is tired or scared. Very young kangaroos cannot live without their mamas. But an older joey knows how to hop on its own.
