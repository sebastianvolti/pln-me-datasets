      A tornado is a big windstorm. Tornado winds spin very fast. They often make a long cloud that looks a little like an ice cream cone. It is called a funnel cloud. Tornado winds can harm things on the ground. They can break trees. They can harm buildings. They can destroy cars and boats. If a tornado is coming, people should go to a basement or another safe place. They should stay there until the storm passes.
