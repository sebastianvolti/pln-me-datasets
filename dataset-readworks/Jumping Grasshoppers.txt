   Grasshoppers are unusual insects. They can walk, hop, and even fly. Grasshoppers have five eyes but no ears. They hear with special eardrums that are on the sides of their bellies. Grasshoppers use their short front legs to eat and walk. Their large back legs help grasshoppers hop and make sounds. A grasshopper calls to other grasshoppers by rubbing its back legs against its wings. Can grasshoppers really fly? They can! Their back legs boost them up, and their wings help them fly away from danger.
