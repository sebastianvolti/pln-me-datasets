Â Hieroglyphs in stone In English, we write with letters. The letters stand for sounds. We put them together to make words. Later, we can read the words. We can also share them with others. This is one way people remember and share things. In ancient Egypt, people wrote things too. But they did not use letters and words like English writing. They used pictures or signs instead. These signs are called hieroglyphs (HIE-row-gliffs). Some hieroglyphs were pictures of the things they stood for. Other ones stood for gods, people, or events. And some hieroglyphs stood for sounds. This kind of writing was written from right to left. It was often carved into stone. It can be found on sculptures and structures from thousands of years ago!
