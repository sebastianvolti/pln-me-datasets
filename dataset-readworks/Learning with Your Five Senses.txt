   How do people learn about the world around them? They use their five senses! The five senses are sight, touch, smell, hearing, and taste. Pretend you are in a grocery store. Maybe you see a stand filled with apples. You see those apples with your eyes. Then, maybe you pick an apple up. It feels smooth. Your hands helped you feel the apple. Give the apple a sniff. It smells… apple-y! Your nose told you that. Oh no, you dropped the apple! It made a THUNK noise when it fell. Your ears helped you hear that sound. Maybe you buy the apple and bring it home. Then, you can take a bite. Your tongue lets you taste the apple. Mmmm, it tastes great!
