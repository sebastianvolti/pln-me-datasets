   Humpback whales live in Earth’s oceans. Each fall, these whales take a trip. They leave the area where ocean water is cold. They swim to warm ocean water. Why? The mother whales want to have their babies. They want to have their babies in warm water. When they are born, the babies will already know how to swim. They will drink their mothers’ milk and grow. Then the mothers and babies will swim back to the cold water.
