   Do you want to see a butterfly flutter by your garden? Then you should plant a lot of flowers. Butterflies like sunny gardens and colorful flowers. They drink the sweet juice that is in the flowers. Butterflies taste the juice with their feet. They sip the juice with a tube that is on their head. They use the tube like a straw. You might see butterflies in the spring, summer, and fall. Happy butterfly watching!
