But stars are in the sky both day and night. So why do we only see stars at night? In the daytime we see the sun shine. Our sun is a very bright star. It's closer to us. The sun’s bright light blocks out other stars. It blocks out stars that are far away. When evening comes, we cannot see the sun. Its bright light goes away. We see a dark night sky. That lets us see the lights of other stars.
