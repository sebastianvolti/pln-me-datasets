   Max’s clubhouse was falling apart. He told his mom that he wanted to build a new one. “First, you need a plan,” said Max’s mom. “Let’s figure out what the new clubhouse should look like.”  They worked together. Max and his mom made a small house out of play clay. Max showed his mom what he wanted. He wanted a door on the house. He wanted two windows on the house. He wanted to paint the house red. Then his mom told him what she wanted. “I want the house to be safe,” said Max’s mom. “I will help you build it.”
