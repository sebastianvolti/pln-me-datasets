   Owls have claws and beaks. They have big eyes that see very well in the dark. But owls cannot move their eyes from side to side. An owl can only look straight ahead. So how does it see something that is behind it? The owl turns its head all the way around! Humans can't do that. If people want to see what is behind them, they have to turn their bodies around. But an owl can rotate just its head to look in the opposite direction. Owls can even turn their heads upside down! The owl’s big eyes and amazing turning head make it a great night hunter.
