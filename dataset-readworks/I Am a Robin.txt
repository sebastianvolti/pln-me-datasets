My parents fed me and my brothers and sisters. We ate earthworms. After about two weeks, my brothers and sisters and I left the nest. My parents followed us around for a few days. They kept feeding us. Then Mom left to build a new nest. Dad stayed with us. He made sure we knew where to roost at night. I rested in a tree with other robins. Soon, I was ready to be on my own.
