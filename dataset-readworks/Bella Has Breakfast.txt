   Bella was eating breakfast with her dad. “These eggs are salty!”  she said. “They are making me thirsty.”  Bella picked up her dad’s coffee by mistake. “Yuck! This tastes so…” Bella could not find a word for the taste of coffee. “Bitter!”  laughed Dad. “Yes, bitter,” said Bella. “Try some lemonade instead,” said Dad. He handed Bella a glass of lemonade. Bella made a funny face. “It is too sour!”  cried Bella. Dad added a little sugar. “Use your sense of taste to tell me how it is now,” said Dad. “Now it is sweet,” said Bella. “I love it!”
