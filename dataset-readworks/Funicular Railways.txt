   Many places around the world have steep hills. It can be hard to get up and down these hills safely. So how can people get up and down these hills? In some places, people can take a funicular! This is a special kind of railway. It is made to go up and down steep hills. The parts of the funicular that go up and down a hill are called the cars. One car gets pulled up the hill. It is pulled by a strong metal rope. On the other end of the rope is another car. That car goes down the hill at the same time. The two cars balance each other out. That way, the car going down the hill doesn’t go too fast. And the car going up the hill can make it to the top!
