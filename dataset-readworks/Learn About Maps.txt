   Maps are pictures of places. Special drawings on maps help people use them. A compass rose is a symbol found on maps. It shows directions. The compass rose has four main points. One point shows which way is north. Another shows south. Other points show east and west. A map key is a box with pictures and words. The words tell what a picture stands for. The word city may be next to a dot. The word forest may be next to a tree. The map key shows people what the drawings on the map mean.
