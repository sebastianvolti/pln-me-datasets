She wears number 10 because she and her sister were born in October (the 10th month)! She has won three WNBA championships. And she’s won four gold medals at the Olympics! She has also won many other awards. Sue is known for her leadership, teamwork, and basketball skills. She is the oldest player in the WNBA… and she is still going strong. Go, Sue!
