We call these animals nocturnal. That means "awake at night." Nocturnal animals sleep during the day. At night, they eat, move, and make noise. In a forest at night, you might hear owls hooting. You might hear crickets chirping. You could hear a mouse running over dry leaves. The forest is a busy place at night.
