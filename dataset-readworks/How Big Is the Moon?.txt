 The moon is Earthâ€™s nearest neighbor in space. The moon is millions of miles closer to Earth than any of the planets. You might think the moon is as large as the sun. After all, the full moon looks very big when it is in the night sky. Actually, the moon is tiny compared with the sun. You could fit millions of moons inside the sun. The only reason the moon looks big to us is because it is so close to Earth. In fact, the moon is much smaller than Earth, too. Our home planet is nearly four times larger than our moon!
