   Did you know that television has changed a lot over the years? The first TV sets had pictures only in black and white. The sets could not show color. People could choose from only a few channels to watch. People had to turn a dial on the TV to change the channel. Some TV shows back then were funny comedies. Today, TV sets show pictures in color. People have hundreds of channels to watch. TVs come with remote controls. Now people can change channels from across the room. A lot about television has changed. But even today, some TV shows are funny comedies!
