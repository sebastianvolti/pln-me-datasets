 chocolate chip cookies Have you ever tasted a delicious chocolate chip cookie? If so, you should thank Ruth Wakefield! Ruth Wakefield baked a lot. One day, Ruth Wakefield was baking cookies for her friends. She was trying to make chocolate cookies. But she was out of the chocolate she always used. That chocolate would melt to make a chocolate cookie. She used a different kind of chocolate bar instead. She baked the cookies, but the chocolate did not fully melt. She created chocolate chip cookies by accident! Chocolate chip cookies were very popular. They are now the most popular cookies in the United States. Thank goodness for Ruth’s accident!
