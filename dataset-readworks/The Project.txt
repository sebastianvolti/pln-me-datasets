He fell and broke his leg. Marcus was stuck at home. He was going to miss his presentation. Mom came into his room with a laptop computer. “What’s that for?”  asked Marcus. “I’m setting up a video chat,” said Mom. “You will be able to present your project to your class … from bed.”  Soon Marcus saw his friends and his teacher on the screen. “Hello, Marcus,” said his teacher. “We are ready to learn about skateboarding!”
