By Robert Balog from PixabayA brown bear. A bear is a mammal. It is a warm-blooded animal with a lot of fur covering its skin. Baby bears are called cubs and stay with their mother for a long time. The mother feeds them and teaches them how to survive in the woods. A bear has a very large body, with short legs and a short tail. It also has very sharp claws and teeth. Even though a bear is large and heavy, it can run fast, climb trees, and even swim. A bear has an excellent sense of smell. It uses this to find food. Most bears prefer to eat plants and not animals. But some bears that live near rivers like to eat fish, especially salmon.
