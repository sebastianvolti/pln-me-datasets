   The Pilgrims were people who came from England to North America long ago. Many of them left on a ship called the Mayflower. The Pilgrims came here so they could worship in their own way. Pilgrim families wanted to start a new life here. The Pilgrims landed near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. They worked hard to build their new village. On land, the Pilgrims met native people who already lived there. They were called the Wampanoag (WAMP-ah-nog). The Wampanoag helped the Pilgrims. They showed the Pilgrims how to hunt and grow food crops, such as corn. Then the Pilgrims had enough food to live.
