They played hip hop music while they danced. The music made me feel excited!  My favorite move was the headspin. The dancer did a headstand and spun around. It looked really hard. I felt amazed watching that dancer. I clapped really hard after that move. My momâ€™s favorite dance move was called a dolphin dive. The dancer put his hands on the floor and held his body up in the air. Then he slowly lowered his body down to the ground. My mom said that the dancer must be very strong. I liked the dolphin dive too. But it made me feel a little scared. I was worried that the dancer would fall.  The hip hop dance show was fun. I hope we go again soon!
