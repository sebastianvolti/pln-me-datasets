   Ava’s brother Jarrell was going to go to her school. Ava had an idea. She got a piece of paper and crayons. She drew a box at the top of the paper. Next to it she wrote “Ava’s classroom.”  She drew a box at the bottom of the paper and wrote “Jarrell’s classroom.”   She drew two more boxes in between. On the first one she wrote “the office.”  On the second one she wrote “the gym.”   Next Ava drew a blue dot. She wrote “water fountain” next to the dot. Ava showed the page to her brother. It was a map of the school. Jarrell was happy. Now he knew where he was going. He could even find the water fountain!
