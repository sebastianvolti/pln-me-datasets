   Have you heard of the country Iceland? Iceland is a small island country. It is located in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is pretty far north! Iceland may sound like it’s a very icy place because of its name. But it is a place with lots of different types of land. There are places with lots of ice. Those places are called ice caps or glaciers. There are also places with lots of green grass and moss. And there are places covered in lava that’s turned into rock. That lava came from volcanoes that erupted in the past. Iceland has many volcanoes!
