   The Declaration of Independence was written over 200 years ago. Thomas Jefferson was its main writer. Other people helped him. At that time, some European countries had colonies in North America. England had 13 colonies. The colonies were considered part of the country of England. The people living in the colonies wanted to have their own country. The declaration said that the English colonies would be free from England. They would become the United States of America. The Declaration of Independence is now in Washington, D.C. Every year on July 4, the United States celebrates the declaration and its independence.
