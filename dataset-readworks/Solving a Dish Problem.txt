 This is what a dishwasher looks like today. Have you helped your parents wash dishes? It helps to have a dishwasher! Dishwashers make washing dishes much faster. A dishwasher is a machine that sprays water and soap on plates and cups to clean them. Josephine Cochran used to wash dishes by hand. But some dishes would break. So she solved the problem! She invented the first dishwasher.  This photo shows a boy washing dishes. Josephine made sure her machine could fit plates, cups, and bowls. She showed her dishwasher at the Chicago World’s Fair. The Fair gave many people the chance to show their inventions. The dishwasher was a success!
