   A country has laws. Laws are rules. They tell what people are allowed, and not allowed, to do. Laws keep people safe. Some laws keep people from driving too fast. Road signs remind people of the safe speed. Laws keep places clean. Some places have laws so that people don’t litter. When people litter, they throw trash on the ground. Signs often remind people not to litter. A good citizen obeys the laws. What if the law is unfair? Then people can work to change it.
