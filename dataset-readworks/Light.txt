Flashlights give off light. Televisions give off light. Clear things let light pass through. Water lets light pass through. Glass lets light pass through. Some objects block light. A tree blocks light. A dog blocks light. Will light go through you? No! What happens when light shines on you? It makes a shadow. The shadow is dark.
