   Your sense of smell is one way you learn about the world around you. It is one of your five senses. Your nose helps you smell. When something near you has a smell, that smell travels through the air. When you breathe in through your nose, the smell goes in. A part of your nose can tell what the smell is. Your nose can tell what 10,000 different smells are! Your sense of smell helps keep you safe. It tells you when food smells like it has gone bad. That way you don’t eat it and get sick. Thank goodness for your sense of smell!
