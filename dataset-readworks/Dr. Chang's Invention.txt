Dr. Chang studied hard and became a doctor. He was a doctor who fixed people’s hearts. The heart is an important part of the body. It helps push blood through the body.  Sometimes, people have heart problems. Some of these people might need a new heart. Dr. Chang thought of a solution.  He helped create a fake heart! He made a tube that connects the fake heart to the rest of the body. This tube helps get blood to and from the heart. Many doctors use his invention all over the world. They replace people’s hearts with fake hearts. These fake hearts can fix many heart problems. Dr. Chang’s invention saved many people’s lives!
