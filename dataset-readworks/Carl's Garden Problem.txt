   Carl wanted to grow a garden. Mrs. Sanchez was Carl’s neighbor. She gave Carl flower seeds. Carl planted them. Mr. Brown was Carl’s neighbor too. He saw Carl planting. “I have vegetable plants in pots,” Mr. Brown said. “Would you like to plant those too?”  “Yes, thank you!”  said Carl. Mr. Brown helped Carl plant the vegetables. “My vegetables keep falling over,” said Carl. Mr. Brown went to his shed. He came back with long, thin sticks. “These are tomato stakes. They will hold the plants up,” said Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown put the stakes in the ground. “Now the plants will grow tall!”  said Carl.
