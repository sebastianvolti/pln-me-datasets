 Many years ago, people used horses to get from one place to another. Sometimes, people rode on the backs of the horses. Other times, horses were used to pull carriages. The carriages carried people where they wanted to go. The roads were made mostly of dirt. The ride was bumpy. But the people got where they wanted to go. When people wanted to move things, they used wagons. The wagons carried food, milk, ice, and other things. Horses pulled the wagons too. A driver held the reins and guided the horses. That was long ago. Today, some people still use horses, carriages, and wagons. But now many people use trains, cars, and planes.
