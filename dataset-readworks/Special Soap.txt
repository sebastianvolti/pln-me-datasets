   Ethan and Dad were making their own laundry soap. “Why are we doing this, Dad?”  Ethan asked. “Soap at the store is expensive, and it can hurt Earth,” his dad explained. “Our soap is not expensive. It will not harm Earth.”  Ethan mixed three powders. He mixed baking soda, washing soda, and borax. Dad added vinegar. The mixture bubbled. It turned dry and lumpy. Finally, the soap was ready. “Now let’s wash some laundry!”  shouted Ethan.
