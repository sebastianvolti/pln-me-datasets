 U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Mrs. Lee put up a large United States map. It showed all 50 states. “The different, bright colors show the different states,” she said. “The blue parts show water.”  The map showed all the state capitals. It marked the state capitals with a star. Mrs. Lee pointed to the state of Maine. “Who can find the capital of Maine?”  she asked. Jill pointed to the city of Augusta. “What is the capital of the United States?”  asked Mrs. Lee. “Washington, D.C.,” said Tom. “The map has a special mark for that,” he added. “It shows a red square. Nearby I see the words Washington and D.C.”
