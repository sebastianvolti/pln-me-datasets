   Rain helps our land. But too much rain can cause a flood. A flood happens when a lot of water rises and moves onto land. The water can go into houses and other buildings. Floods can happen near rivers and oceans. Big storms can quickly cause floods. People must leave places where the water is high. Some people must go in boats. They must go to a safe place.
