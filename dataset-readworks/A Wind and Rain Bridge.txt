So they have a roof. They also have structures called pavilions. People can meet or rest inside them. One famous wind and rain bridge is the Chengyang Bridge. It is very grand. It has five pavilions! This bridge is also special because of how it was made. It was made mostly from wood long ago. But the builders did not use any nails to hold it together! They cut the wood to make it fit together. And the bridge still stands strong today!
