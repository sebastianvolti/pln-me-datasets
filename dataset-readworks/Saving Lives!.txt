 This is what a life raft looks like today. A life raft is kind of like a small boat. People keep life rafts on big ships. In emergencies, people use life rafts for safety. If a ship is in danger, the people on it can escape on the life rafts. Today, life rafts are inflatable. That means they can be filled with air. This helps them float.  This is what a life raft looked like before Maria’s invention. Life rafts used to be made of just wood. So they could catch on fire easily. They also did not have safety rails. Maria Beasley changed that. Maria loved thinking of new ideas. She invented many things. Her best invention was a new life raft. Her life raft had safety rails. It was easy to use. It was also less likely to catch on fire. Some people saw her as only a housewife. But Maria proved them wrong! Her life rafts saved many people’s lives.
