A rattlesnake eats small animals such as mice. The snake kills the mouse. Then it swallows the mouse whole. A rattlesnake has a rattle on its tail. The rattle is made of pieces of hard skin. The snake moves its tail. Then the pieces rattle together. The noise the pieces make is a little like a baby’s rattle. But a rattlesnake is a lot more dangerous than a baby!
