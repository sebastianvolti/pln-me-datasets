 An ostrich is a bird that cannot fly. It lives in the deserts and grasslands of Africa. Ostriches run quickly on their skinny legs. They have long necks and huge eyes. An ostrich lays big eggs. An egg is about as big as an American football! One egg can be as heavy as twenty-four chicken eggs. Ostriches are sometimes called “camel birds” because they have long necks like camels. Ostriches are like camels in another way. They can live without water for a long time. Ostriches get water from the leaves and seeds they eat.
