 Temple in an old city of the Mayas in Mexico A long time ago, many groups of Native Americans lived in Mexico. The Aztecs were one. The Mayas were another. Some of them had strong civilizations. Then, Spanish explorers came to Mexico. They took over the area and built their own cities. The Spanish ruled Mexico for almost three hundred years. Today, that past can be seen in the people of Mexico. Some people have a Native American heritage. Most people have a mix of Native American and European heritage. That past can also be seen in the languages of Mexico. Almost everyone in Mexico can speak Spanish. But Spanish isn’t the only national language. Every language spoken by Native Americans in Mexico is also a national language. That’s more than 60 languages in all!
