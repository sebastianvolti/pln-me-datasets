   Have you ever hit a piñata? This game comes from Mexico. Piñatas are decorated containers with candy and fruit inside. People hang them up. Then, kids tie blindfolds around their eyes. They break open the piñata with a stick. Candy comes falling out! Piñatas have a long history. They have been important in Mexico for a long time. Some Native American groups had games like piñatas long ago. Then, Spanish people came to Mexico. They used piñatas to teach the Native Americans about the Catholic religion. Different parts of the game stood for evil, hope, and faith. Today, the piñata is still used in Mexico. But now it’s just used for fun! It can be found at parties and celebrations.
