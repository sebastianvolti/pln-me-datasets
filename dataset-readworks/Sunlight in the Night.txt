But we know that the moon does not make its own light. Moonlight is really light from the sun. The moon reflects the sunlight. When something is reflected, it is thrown back. The sun’s light is thrown back to Earth. That makes the moon look as if it has its own light. What you are really seeing is the reflection of the sun’s light.
