   Earth has one moon. Our moon is thousands of miles away. It travels around Earth. How long does the trip take? The moon goes around Earth in about one month. The moon looks bright. But it does not give off light. It reflects light from the sun. You can sometimes see the moon during the day. The best time to see the moon is at night. Wait for the sun to set. It will get dark soon. Look up in the sky. Can you see the moon?
