   Open a book. What do you see? You probably see some words. Now look at a sheet of music. It looks very different. Sheet music has lines and symbols. People who write music are called composers. They can use symbols to show sounds on sheet music. These symbols are called musical notes. The musical notes can mean high sounds or low sounds. They also can mean long or short sounds. Composers can use other symbols too. Some symbols show how loud sounds are. Some symbols even show how fast the music goes. Musicians can read the musical notes and other symbols in sheet music. Then they can play the music.
