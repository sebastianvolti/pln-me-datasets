   Everything about an elephant is big. It has big ears. It has big eyes and big tusks. It can weigh as much as a school bus! An elephant also has a long trunk. It uses its trunk to breathe and to smell. It uses its trunk to find leaves and fruits to eat. An elephant can shower itself with its trunk. It sucks up water and sprays its back. A mother elephant can hold her baby close with her trunk. She can even use her trunk to help lift her baby or move it away from trouble. For example, she might use her trunk to save her baby from getting stuck in mud!
