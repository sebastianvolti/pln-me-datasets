   My grandma sent me an e-mail message. When did I receive it? Right away! E-mail is electronic mail. It is much faster than sending a letter. E-mail usually arrives on a computer minutes after it is sent. Many people think that a man named Ray Tomlinson invented e-mail. Ray wanted to solve a problem at his office. Some people did not answer their phone calls. Ray came up with a way to send messages from computer to computer. Ray sent the first e-mail in 1971. It was most likely “QWERTYUIOP.”  What does that mean? Nothing! It was just a test message. Now everyone can send and receive e-mails. Thanks, Ray!
