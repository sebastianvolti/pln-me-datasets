 This is a drawing of Lyda’s hairbrush. Lyda Newman was an African American hairdresser. But that’s not all she was. She was also an inventor! She created the modern hairbrush. Her hairbrush could get dust and dirt out of hair. It also was easy to clean. Lyda was a great inventor. But she did even more!  This photo shows women fighting for women's rights in the United States in 1912. Lyda Newman also fought for women’s rights in the United States. Many years ago, women couldn’t vote. Lyda would go and talk about this problem. She got many people to support the cause! She kept fighting for these rights all her life. Lyda was a strong woman who fought for change. Go Lyda!
