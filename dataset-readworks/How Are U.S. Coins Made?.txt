 U.S. coins The United States Mint is the part of the American government that makes coins. Coins are made at different locations in the United States. They are made at U.S. Mint buildings in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, and West Point. How are U.S. coins made? First, a blank coin is cut from a big piece of metal. Once it’s cut, the coin is heated up to make it soft. Then, the coin is cooled. Next, the coin takes a bath in some chemicals. This cleans the coin and makes it shiny. Then, it is dried off. The coin is then pressed with a design on its front and back. Did you know that the U.S. Mint can make up to 28 billion coins in just one year?
