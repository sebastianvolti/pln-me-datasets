Â This is an illustration of Squanto. Long ago, the Pilgrims came to North America from England. Life was very hard for the Pilgrims in North America. The land was new to them. They did not know how to find food. After a few months, they met a Native American man named Squanto. Squanto was living with the Wampanoag. They were a group of Native American people. Later, Squanto started living with the Pilgrims. Squanto helped the Pilgrims a lot. Squanto knew the land well. He spoke English, too. He showed the Pilgrims where to catch fish. He taught them how to plant corn. He helped them find berries to eat. Squanto also helped the Pilgrims talk to different Native American groups. The Pilgrims trusted Squanto. They thanked Squanto for his help.
