   One day, Emma and Tasha were wearing the same shirt to school. “We must be twins. We look the same,” joked Tasha. Emma laughed. “Everyone in the class looks the same to me,” said Mr. Reed. “What do you mean, Mr. Reed?”  asked Mike. “I have red hair, and Luis has brown hair.”  “And my eyes are brown, but Kate’s are green,” said Vincent. “That is true,” said Mr. Reed. “But you all have two eyes and two ears. You all have noses and mouths. You are all the same!”  “I guess we are all twins, then,” said Tasha. Everyone laughed.
