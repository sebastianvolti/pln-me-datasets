 American Flag from 1795 to 1818 American Flag since 1960 O say can you see…  Do you know those words? They are the start of the national anthem of the United States of America. A national anthem is a song that represents a country. The United States anthem is called “The Star-Spangled Banner.”  The words star-spangled banner means a flag that is decorated with stars. The song tells the story of a battle the United States was fighting 200 years ago. The writer sees the American flag flying at night as bombs and rockets are exploding. In the morning, he wonders if the U.S. flag is still there: O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave / O’er [over] the land of the free and the home of the brave? This song celebrates the United States as a land of freedom.
