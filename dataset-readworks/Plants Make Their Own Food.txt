   All living things need energy. Energy gives living things strength. Without energy, living things die. Humans and animals get energy from food. They must find food so their bodies will have energy to live. Plants are different from humans and animals. Most plants do not have to find food. Instead, they make their own! Plants mix water, gas from the air, and light from the sun. That mixture turns into a kind of sugar inside the plant. The sugar gives plants energy. That energy keeps plants alive.
