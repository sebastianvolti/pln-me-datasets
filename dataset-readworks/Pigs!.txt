Their skin is thick with stiff hair.  Pigs have funny, round noses that are called snouts. Their snouts help them find food underground. Wild pigs also have tusks to help them dig for food.  Wild pigs are found mostly in the forests and grasslands of Europe, Asia, and Africa. They eat leaves, roots, and fruits. They also eat small reptiles and rodents, like mice.  Pigs are raised on farms all over the world, except for Antarctica. Farmers feed their pigs grains, such as corn and barley. Every day, many farm pigs eat about seven pounds of food. Thatâ€™s over 100 bowls of Cheerios in a day!
