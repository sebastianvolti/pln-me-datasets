   What is Presidents’ Day? Even if you have never heard of it, maybe you can guess. It is a holiday in honor of the Presidents of the United States.  Presidents’ Day began as George Washington’s Birthday. George Washington was born on February 22nd. After he died, people started to honor him on that day. Then the United States made his birthday a national holiday. National means for the whole country. Later on, the government changed the date of the holiday. Washington’s Birthday would be celebrated on the third Monday of February. The government wanted the day to come after a weekend.  After that, people used the day to honor other Presidents too. Now many have stopped calling it Washington’s Birthday. Instead, they call it Presidents’ Day.
