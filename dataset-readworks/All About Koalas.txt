   Koalas are cute animals. Some koalas live in zoos in our country. Do you know what koalas eat? At first, they drink their mothers’ milk. Later, they eat special leaves. These are eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhss) leaves. Koalas use their noses to smell the leaves. They will not eat leaves that smell bad. Koalas do not drink much water. They get their water from the leaves. Guess what the word koala means? It means “no drink.”
