   Fernando and Zoey go to a plant sale. They buy mint plants. They like the minty smell of the leaves. Fernando puts his plant near a sunny window. Zoey puts her plant in her bedroom. Fernando’s plant looks green and healthy after a few days. But Zoey’s plant has some brown leaves. “Your plant needs more light,” Fernando says. Zoey moves her plant to a sunny window. Soon, both plants look green and healthy!
