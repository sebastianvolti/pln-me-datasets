   Winter starts on the shortest day of the year. We call that day the winter solstice. Winter days are colder. There is less sunshine. Some places get snow and ice. People spend more time indoors. Why do we have winter? Earth tilts as it travels around the sun. When the northern half of Earth tilts away from the sun, that part of Earth has winter. Winter starts in the northern half of Earth around December 21. At the same time, it is summer in southern half of Earth. That is because the Earth’s southern half is tilted toward the sun.
