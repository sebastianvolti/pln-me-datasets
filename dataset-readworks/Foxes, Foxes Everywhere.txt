By David Mark from PixabayA fox. Foxes live nearly everywhere. Red foxes live in woods or farmland all around the world. Arctic foxes live in cold places, like the North Pole. Fennec foxes live in the deserts of North Africa. A fox probably lives near you! Foxes hunt for food at night. They look for food when large animals won’t see them. Foxes look for birds and small mammals, such as rabbits and mice. They use their super noses to sniff for food in the dark.  Some people think that foxes are “sly,” which means tricky. But foxes are just very careful and shy. A smart fox will wait until any sign of danger is gone before it goes into a town. So, a fox may be in your town, but you probably won’t see it.
