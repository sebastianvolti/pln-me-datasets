Dov HarringtonMenorah Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday. It lasts for eight days. On each day a candle is lit. The candles are in a candleholder called a menorah. Candles are lit because of a Jewish story. It is about a time long ago. Jewish people were in a temple. They had to light a menorah using oil. They only had enough oil for one day. But somehow it lasted eight days!  The days of Hanukkah change every year. Sometimes it starts in November. Other times it starts in December. People celebrate Hanukkah in several ways. They sing songs. They play games. One game is played with a toy called a dreidel.  People also celebrate by eating latkes. Latkes are potato pancakes.
