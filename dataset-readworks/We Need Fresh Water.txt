   Our planet is Earth. Water covers most of our planet. Almost all of that water is salt water. Salt water is very salty. People, animals, and plants need fresh water to live. Fresh water is not salty. Earth does not have as much fresh water as salt water. People should remember to use fresh water carefully. They should never waste it. Where is Earth’s fresh water? Fresh water is found in rivers, lakes, and streams. It can also be found under the ground. Machines pump the water to the surface for people to use.
