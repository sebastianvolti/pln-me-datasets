Kamil and his dad watched over her. Soon Kamil fell asleep. Suddenly he woke up. He heard little noises. “Squeak, squeak.”  Kamil looked. There was Lucy with five puppies! She was licking the puppies clean. Kamil knew Lucy would be a good mother. He looked at her puppies. Four were brown and white like Lucy. One puppy was all black! Kamil thought, “He is the one for me.”
