   How do you hear? With your ears, of course! Hearing is one of your five senses. There is sound all around you. Your ears help you take in those sounds. That way, you know more about what is happening around you. The part of the ear that you can see is called the pinna. This is the part that gathers sounds. From there, the sound goes further into your ear. When the sound goes further in, it reaches your eardrum. Your eardrum is not a real drum! It’s a piece of skin. The sound makes your eardrum shake. And that makes other parts far inside your ear move, too. When that happens, your brain knows that you heard a sound. It tells you what you heard!
