NOAATwo men going to the Challenger Deep in a submarine in 1960 The ocean is very important. But people do not know a lot about it! We have studied some parts of it, like the shallow areas. But we have a lot to learn about the deep parts. The deepest part of the ocean is called Challenger Deep. It is part of a deep, narrow ditch in the ocean floor. People have only gone there twice. The first time was in 1960. Two men went there in a submarine. But they could not collect any samples. And they could not take pictures. The second time was in 2012. That year, a man went there by himself. He collected rocks and animals. He also took video. With that information, we can start to learn more about the deepest part of the ocean.
