 Venus flytraps Do you know what a Venus flytrap is? The Venus flytrap is a plant! It’s a special plant because of something it does. It catches, or traps, flies and other bugs. Plants use sunlight to make sugar. That is their food. But plants need vitamins too. Most plants get vitamins from the soil they grow in. But Venus flytraps grow in soil with almost no vitamins. So they get vitamins from bugs! Many bugs fly around at night. Sometimes a bug lands on the leaves of a Venus flytrap. When that happens, the leaves close around the bug. The leaves trap the bug inside! When the bug dies, the vitamins in its body go into the plant. Watch out, bugs! Venus flytraps need their vitamins!
