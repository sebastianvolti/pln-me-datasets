   Some schools have a special helper. That helper is the school nurse. What does the school nurse do? The nurse helps you if you feel sick or get hurt. The nurse might give you an eye test or a hearing test. The nurse shows you the right way to wash your hands. The nurse also teaches you about healthy foods. Be sure to thank your school nurse for helping you stay healthy!
