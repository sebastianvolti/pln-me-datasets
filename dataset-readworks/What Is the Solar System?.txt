   The sun and eight planets make up our solar system. The sun gives off heat and light. The planets move around the sun. They spin as they move. Mercury is one of those planets. It is closest to the sun. Earth is one of those planets too. We live on Earth. As Earth spins, part of it faces the sun. That part of Earth is having daytime. The other part of Earth is dark then. The dark part is having nighttime.
