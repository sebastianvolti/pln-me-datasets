   Hi, my name is Noah! My town has a fall festival each year. My grandpa has been going since he was a boy. He remembers seeing people show their arts and crafts. He remembers eating apple pie. He remembers that the festival was crowded but not too noisy. Today, the festival still gets crowded. Today, people still show their arts and crafts. Today, people still sell apple pie. But now there is lots of loud music. The festival can be very noisy. What is my favorite thing about the festival? I like eating the apple pie. That was Grandpa’s favorite thing when he was a boy too.
