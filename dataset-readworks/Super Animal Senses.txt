   There are five senses that both humans and many animals have. But some animals have one sense that is super sharp. Chameleons have super sight. They can move their two eyes separately from each other. Chameleons can look two ways at the same time. Catfish have super taste. Humans have taste buds on our tongues. Catfish have taste buds all over their bodies. Catfish are like swimming tongues! Red foxes have super hearing. They can hear mice squeaking under the snow from very far away. The red fox’s super hearing helps it catch dinner in the wintertime!
