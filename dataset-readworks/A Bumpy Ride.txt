 Some amusement parks have bumper-car rides. People sit inside the small cars. They wear safety belts. People can turn the cars in different directions. The cars slip and slide around on a shiny metal floor. The cars bump into other cars. The cars bump into the wall around the track. The cars have rubber bumpers around them. The rubber bumpers keep people safe. Do you think it sounds like fun to ride in a bumper car?
