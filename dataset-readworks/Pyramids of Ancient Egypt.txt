 Pyramids in Egypt Long ago, people in Egypt built huge pyramids. Do you know what a pyramid looks like? It has a flat base. The base is a square. The pyramid has four sides. These are shaped like triangles. They touch at the top to form a point. The pyramids were built for the pharaohs. Pharaohs were the rulers of Egypt. The pyramids were their tombs. A pharaoh was put inside one after he died. The tombs are shaped like pyramids for a reason. Egyptians thought the pyramids helped the pharaoh’s soul go up to the sky. Then it could be with the gods. Egyptians also thought part of the pharaoh’s spirit stayed behind. So they filled pyramids with things to take care of the spirit. They left food, gold, and other riches in the tombs.
