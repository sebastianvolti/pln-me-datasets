Manjula RamanPonte Vecchio In Italy, there is a city named Florence. The Arno River runs through it. And the Ponte Vecchio stands over the Arno. What is the Ponte Vecchio? Well, its name means "Old Bridge" in Italian. And it is an old bridge. It was built in the 1300s! It was built to take the place of another bridge that had been there. That other bridge had been washed away in a flood. The Ponte Vecchio is easy to recognize. That's because of the shops built on it. These shops are on both sides of the bridge. They have windows with shutters. Parts of them stick out over the water! But so far, the shops and the bridge have stood the test of time.
