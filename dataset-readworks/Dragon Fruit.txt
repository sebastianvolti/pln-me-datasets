   A cactus is a kind of plant that grows in dry places. These plants do not have leaves. Instead, many of them have spines. The spines are sharp needles. Some cacti grow fruit. One kind of fruit that grows on cacti is the dragon fruit. The dragon fruit does not look like many other fruits. It can be bright pink. It is the size of a grown-up’s hand. And it has green spines! This fruit’s spines are not sharp like the ones on a cactus. They are bendy. They curve down over the fruit’s skin.
