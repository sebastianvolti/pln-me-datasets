They walked to the ice cream store. “I have a surprise,” Troy said. “What is it?”  Tara asked. “Happy birthday; pick a treat!”  Troy said.  “Thank you,” said Tara. “I’ll have a vanilla sundae with chocolate on top.”  Troy saw that the price of a sundae was $5. Then the girl at the counter smiled at Troy and Tara. “Today, we have a special sale price,” she said. “You can have two sundaes for $5!”
