   LiAnn has a new baby brother. His name is Nick. All day relatives have been visiting. Grandma and Grandpa came to visit. “Oh, he looks like his dad!”  said Grandma. Then Uncle Joe and Aunt Jasmin came to visit. “Oh, he looks like his mom!”  said Uncle Joe. “He looks a little like LiAnn,” said Aunt Jasmin. “Why does everyone think Nick looks like us?”  asked LiAnn. “Babies often look like their parents,” said Mom. “And sometimes they look like their brothers or sisters,” said Dad. “Well, I think he looks like Nick!”  said LiAnn.
