The car starts and the wheels spin. The machine checks all the car’s parts. If the car has a problem, it is fixed. Then the car gets another test. Workers drive it on a test track. Any new problems are fixed. Then the car is driven on a road. If the car passes, more cars can be built. Then the new cars can be sold!
