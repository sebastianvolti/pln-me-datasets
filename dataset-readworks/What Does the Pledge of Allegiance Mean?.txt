   I pledge allegiance to the flag Of the United States of America And to the republic for which it stands, One nation under God, indivisible, With liberty and justice for all.  A pledge is a promise. Allegiance means faithfulness. When you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you are making a promise. You promise to be faithful to the United States of America. Indivisible means cannot be divided. There are 50 states, but they work together. The United States cannot be broken apart. Liberty means freedom. Justice means fairness. The last line means that everyone is free. Everyone can expect to be treated fairly. We say this pledge every morning at school. It reminds us of our promise to our country.
