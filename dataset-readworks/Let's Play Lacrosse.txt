Players try to get the ball into a goal. Native Americans were the first people to play lacrosse. They played the game hundreds of years ago. The ball was made of animal skin. The stick was made of wood. Only men played lacrosse then. Today, the ball is made of rubber. Balls are usually bright orange or yellow. The stick is made of wood and plastic. Now, anyone can play lacrosse!
