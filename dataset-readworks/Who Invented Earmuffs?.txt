Phot Credit: Donna and Andrew  Chester Greenwood became an inventor when he was 15 years old. An inventor thinks of ideas that solve problems. One day, Chester went ice-skating. His ears felt cold. He covered them with his scarf, but the scarf was itchy. Then Chester had an idea. He asked his grandmother to help him. They made two wire circles and covered them with fur. They connected the circles to each other with a metal band. Chester put his invention on his head. It kept his ears warm. Chester called his invention “earmuffs.”  People liked the invention and bought their own earmuffs. Now every year people in his hometown in Maine have a parade. Everyone wears earmuffs, of course!
