 Polar bears live in ice and snow. A polar bear baby is a cub. A cub is born with its eyes closed. It does not have much hair. A cub drinks its mother’s milk. The mother keeps the cub warm. The cub grows bigger. Soon the cub can walk. Its mother shows it how to hunt. She shows it how to swim. The cub likes to play. It rolls in the snow. The cub grows stronger. The cub learns to swim. It can find its own food. Now the cub can live by itself.
