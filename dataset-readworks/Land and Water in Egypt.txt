   Egypt is a country in Africa. It is in the northeast part of that continent. Egypt gets very little rain. So a lot of it is desert land. Those parts of Egypt are dry and hot. Not all of Egypt is desert. There is also a huge river there. It flows from the south to the north. This river is called the Nile. The land near the Nile River is good for planting. Trees and plants grow there. Farmers can grow things there, too. Without the Nile, they would not be able to grow things. Thank you, Nile!
