 The wolf spider is a special spider. It does not build a web. It hunts for food like a wolf hunts. It walks around on the ground looking for food. Most spiders lay their eggs on their web. The wolf spider mother carries her eggs with her. Many baby spiders hatch from the eggs. The babies are called spiderlings. The mother cares for her spiderlings in an unusual way. She carries them on her back. Soon the little ones will be free to go out on their own.
