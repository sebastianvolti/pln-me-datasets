 seal of the U.S. Mint When the United States first became a country, there was no organized money! People traded animals and used money from other countries to get by. For example, England was one country they used money from. However, soon after the United States became its own country, a man named Alexander Hamilton realized that the country needed its own money. He was the Treasury Secretary of the United States. That means he was in charge of the nation’s finances and money system. So in 1792, the United States Mint was started. This was the part of the government that made coins. It was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The U.S. Mint has been making U.S. coins ever since then. But now, it can be found in six different places across the United States.
