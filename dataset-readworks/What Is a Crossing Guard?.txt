   You see these grown-ups helping people outside your school. You hear them blow whistles. You see them hold up stop signs. They are special helpers who keep people safe. They are crossing guards. Crossing guards stop cars so children can get across streets safely. These guards walk children across a path to the other side of the street. Crossing guards work outdoors in all kinds of weather. They stand near busy roads and streets as cars and trucks drive by. The guards wear bright colors so that drivers will see them. Crossing guards help keep you and your friends safe!
