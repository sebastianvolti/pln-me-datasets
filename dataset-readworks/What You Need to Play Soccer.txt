   Do you want to play soccer? You will need the right clothing. You will need cleats. Cleats are sneakers with small tips on the bottom. The tips are made of rubber or plastic. They look a little like tacks. These tips help you run without slipping. You will need plastic shin guards. Shin guards cover the lower part of your legs. If another player accidentally kicks you, he or she will hit the shin guard instead of your leg. You will need a team shirt. All members of the same team wear shirts of the same color. That helps players find their teammates. Now grab a ball. You are ready to play soccer!
