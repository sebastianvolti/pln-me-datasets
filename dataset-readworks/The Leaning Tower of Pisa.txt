 Leaning Tower of Pisa In the middle part of Italy, there is a city called Pisa. Pisa is home to a very famous building. You may have heard of it. It’s called the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This tower was built to hold church bells. But it’s mostly known because it does not stand straight! It leans over to the side instead. People began building the tower in the year 1173. But soon, the tower started to lean. That’s because it was not built on a good enough base. The ground below the tower had some loose sand and shells. So as the builders made the tower taller, the base moved. Over the years, the tower leaned more and more. Then, people worked to stop it from leaning so much. Now, the tower still leans. But it leans less than it used to.
