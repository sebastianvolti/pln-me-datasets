   It is a very hot day in the African desert. The sun is shining. The sand is hot and the air is dry. A fennec fox stays deep in its hole under the ground. That hole is called a den. The den is cool. Later, the sun sets. It begins to get dark. The sand cools off. Now the fennec fox can go out to find food.
