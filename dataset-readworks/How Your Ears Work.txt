   What do you hear? You may hear people talking. You may hear a car or the wind or music. Your ears help you hear those sounds. Sound travels in waves. The waves go into your outer ear. That is the part you see. Inside your ear, sound waves go through a tiny tunnel. It is called the ear canal. Those waves hit stretched-out pieces of skin called eardrums. The eardrums vibrate. That means they shake back and forth. Your inner ear turns those vibrations into a signal. That signal goes to your brain. The brain understands that the signal is a sound. What is the result? You hear something!
