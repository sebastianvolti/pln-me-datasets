Scientists have very important jobs. They help us learn about the world around us. Jane Goodall is a very important scientist. She has helped us learn a lot about chimpanzees. Jane has studied chimpanzees in Africa. She sits and watches them. She studies the way they eat. She studies the way they act. She even studies the way they tell each other things. Jane has learned that chimpanzees are very smart. They use grass as a tool to catch insects to eat. They talk with one another using sounds. They can even get happy, mad, or sad.  This chimp looks sad. Two chimpanzees sitting together
