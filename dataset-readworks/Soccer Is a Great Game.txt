   Soccer is a team sport. Two teams play. Each team has eleven players. The players try to kick the ball into the other team’s goal. If the ball goes into the goal, their team gets a point. Soccer players have different jobs. The goalkeeper’s job is to protect the goal. Defenders try to get the ball away from the other team. Forwards try to kick the ball into the other team’s goal. Games usually last ninety minutes. The team with the most points is the winner!
