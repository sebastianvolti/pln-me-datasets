 What has four long legs and a long neck, and is the tallest land animal in the world? A giraffe! Giraffes live in groups called herds. The herds are found in the savannas of Africa. Savannas are warm places that have grasses and trees. A giraffe spends a lot of time eating. It likes fresh leaves that grow on trees. The giraffeâ€™s long, black tongue helps it pull leaves off tree branches. Giraffes usually sleep standing up. Sometimes, however, they do lie down. A giraffe can tuck its legs under its body and then rest its head on its back.
