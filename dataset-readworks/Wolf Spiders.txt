 Wolf spiders live all over the world. They are often brown, black, or gray. They have eight eyes. They also have eight legs. Wolf spiders hatch from eggs. Baby spiders are called spiderlings. Their mom takes good care of them. The spiderlings climb onto her back. They stay there for weeks. As a spider grows, it molts. That means it sheds its skin. A wolf spider molts many times during its life. Each time, it gets bigger. Most spiders build webs to catch prey. Wolf spiders do not. They hunt for food. Wolf spiders eat insects and other spiders. They also eat very small animals.
