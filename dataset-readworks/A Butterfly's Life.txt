   Butterflies are beautiful insects. You often see them around colorful flowers. A butterfly’s life begins in a special way. First, a mother butterfly lays an egg on a leaf. A caterpillar hatches from the egg. The caterpillar eats leaves and grows bigger. Next, the caterpillar becomes a chrysalis (KRIS-a-liss). It makes a kind of hard shell that covers its whole body. During the time as a chrysalis, the caterpillar slowly changes. The parts of a butterfly begin to form, like the wings, legs, and antennae. Weeks or months later, a new creature pops out of the chrysalis shell. It has become a butterfly! The butterfly flutters its wings and flies away.
