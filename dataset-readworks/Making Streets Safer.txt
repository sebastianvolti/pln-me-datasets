When people came to a corner, they were not sure who should stop. One day, Garrett Morgan saw a terrible accident. He wanted to prevent accidents in the future. Morgan built a pole with arms. The arms had words on them. The words were Stop, Go, and All Stop. When one direction had a stop sign, the other direction had a go sign. When All Stop went up, everyone had to stop. That made driving safer. Morgan’s traffic signal was used in many places. Today, traffic lights keep people safe. Now people watch for the red, yellow, or green light!
