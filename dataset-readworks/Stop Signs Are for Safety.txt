   Stop signs are red signs. They have eight sides. They have the word stop on them. You may have noticed stop signs on the street. Do you know why we use stop signs? Stop signs help people stay safe. When two roads come together, cars must stop. It can be dangerous if they do not stop. Cars can crash into each other. Drivers stop when they come to stop signs. Then they wait their turn. As long as everyone follows the rules, the road is safe!
