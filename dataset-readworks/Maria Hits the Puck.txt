RoboMichalec from PixabayA hockey player Maria loves playing ice hockey! She plays hockey with a hockey stick and a puck. She plays it on an ice skating rink. Maria has to wear ice skates to skate across the ice.  When Maria hits the puck with her stick, the puck moves. It slides in a straight line across the ice. The puck slides because the ice is slippery.  Sometimes, Maria wants the puck to move slowly. Then, she taps the puck lightly with her stick. Other times, Maria wants the puck to move faster. Then, she hits the puck harder. As long as nothing is in the way, the puck goes straight. Maria has to hit the puck into the goal to win a hockey game. But thereâ€™s a person in the way of the goal. Maria has an idea. She hits the puck very hard. The puck moves fast! It bounces off the side of the goal. Then, it zig-zags into the goal. She scores!
