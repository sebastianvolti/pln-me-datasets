   Have you heard the music Peter and the Wolf by Sergei Prokofiev? There are many characters in the song. What do the bird, duck, cat, and Peter’s grandfather have in common? Woodwind instruments are used for these characters. The flute is the bird. The oboe is the duck. The clarinet is the cat. And the bassoon is Peter’s grandfather. All woodwind instruments were made of wood a long time ago. Now, they can be made of wood, metal, or plastic. Musicians play woodwinds by blowing into them. Smaller woodwinds play higher sounds. Bigger and longer woodwinds play lower sounds.
