She sleeps over at a friend's house. They do a lot of fun activities. They fight with their pillows. They roast marshmallows over a fire. They sing songs. They watch movies. The movies are funny. They eat popcorn while they watch. They braid each other's hair. They use sleeping bags. They fall asleep.
